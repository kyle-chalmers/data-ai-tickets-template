# Snowflake Setup Instructions

Quick setup guides for using Snowflake with Claude Code.

## Available Guides

- **[Snowflake CLI Setup](./SNOWFLAKE_CLI_SETUP.md)** - Command-line interface for data exports and automation
- **[Snowflake MCP Setup](./SNOWFLAKE_MCP_SETUP.md)** - Interactive Snowflake integration with Claude

## Which Should I Use?

See the **[CLI vs MCP Comparison](../SNOWFLAKE_CLI_VS_MCP.md)** in the parent directory.

**Quick answer:**
- **CLI** → CSV exports, large datasets, scheduled tasks
- **MCP** → Interactive exploration, asking questions
- **Both** → Best results (explore with MCP, export with CLI)

## Setup Order

1. Start with **CLI** (easier, covers most use cases)
2. Add **MCP** if you need interactive exploration
3. Use both together for optimal workflow
