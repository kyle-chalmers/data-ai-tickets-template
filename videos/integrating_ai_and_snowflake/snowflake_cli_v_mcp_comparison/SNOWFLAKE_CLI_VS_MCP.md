# Snowflake CLI vs MCP: Comparison Guide

Reference for understanding the differences between Snowflake CLI and MCP approaches.

---

## Overview

Both tools provide access to Snowflake data with significant overlap in capabilities. The CLI excels at data pulling and exporting, while MCP is optimized for querying and interactive analysis. However, they share many use cases and the choice often depends on context requirements, permissioning needs, and integration preferences.

---

## Key Distinguishing Factors

| Feature | CLI | MCP |
|---------|-----|-----|
| **Exporting Data** | ✅ Built-in formats | ⚠️ Requires conversion |
| **Data Limits** | Large datasets | 1 MB response limit |
| **Context Usage** | Minimal tokens | High token consumption |
| **Permission Controls** | Not configurable | ✅ Configurable via YAML |
| **Advanced Services** | Basic access | ✅ Better configured (Cortex, Analyst) |
| **Claude Desktop** | ❌ Not compatible | ✅ Native integration |
| **Token Usage** | ~100 tokens (output) | ~500-5,000+ tokens (data in context) |

---

## Primary Use Cases

### CLI Strengths

**Data Pulling & Export:**
- Native CSV, JSON, and other format support
- Handles large datasets efficiently
- Production reports and scheduled jobs
- Automation and scripting workflows

**Example:**
```bash
snow sql -q "SELECT * FROM customers WHERE country = 'US'" --format csv > data.csv
```

### MCP Strengths

**Interactive Analysis & Querying:**
- Natural language queries
- Conversational context across questions
- Native Claude Desktop integration
- Schema exploration and discovery
- Configured access to Cortex AI services

**Example:**
```
"Show me top customers by revenue and analyze their patterns"
```

---

## Configuration & Permissions

### Snowflake CLI
- No built-in permission controls
- Uses Snowflake role permissions only
- Authentication via config.toml

### Snowflake MCP
- Configurable SQL statement permissions via YAML
- Granular control over allowed operations (SELECT, CREATE, DROP, etc.)
- Service-specific configurations
- Advanced service integration (Cortex Agent, Analyst, Search)
- Authentication via multiple methods

---

## Context & Token Considerations

### CLI
- Minimal Claude context usage
- Data stays external
- ~100 tokens for command output
- Suitable for large dataset operations

### MCP
- Data loaded into Claude's context
- 1 MB response limit
- High token usage for large results (~500-5,000+ tokens)
- Best for small to medium datasets

---

## Workflow Integration

Use **both** together for optimal results:

| Phase | Tool | Purpose |
|-------|------|---------|
| Explore | MCP | Schema discovery, small samples |
| Refine | MCP | Interactive querying, context-aware analysis |
| Extract | CLI | Export large datasets |
| Analyze | Python/Excel | Work with complete data |

**Common Pattern:** Explore with MCP → Export with CLI → Analyze locally

---

## Setup

### CLI Setup
```bash
brew install snowflake-cli
snow connection add --connection-name prod ...
snow connection test
```

### MCP Setup
```bash
pip install uv
claude mcp add --scope user --transport stdio snowflake -- \
  /Users/YOUR_USERNAME/Library/Python/3.9/bin/uvx snowflake-labs-mcp \
  --service-config-file /Users/YOUR_USERNAME/.mcp/snowflake_config.yaml \
  --account YOUR-ACCOUNT \
  --user YOUR-USER \
  --role YOUR-ROLE \
  --private-key-file /Users/YOUR_USERNAME/.snowflake/keys/rsa_key.p8
```

## Summary

**CLI:** Best for data extraction, large datasets, automation, and production workflows.

**MCP:** Best for interactive exploration, natural language queries, Claude Desktop integration, and configured access to advanced Snowflake services.

**Together:** Complementary tools that enable the complete data workflow from exploration to production.
