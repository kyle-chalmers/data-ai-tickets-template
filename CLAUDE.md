# Claude Code Assistant Instructions

## Overview

This document provides instructions for Claude Code when working with the data-intelligence-tickets repository. You have access to several powerful command-line tools that can help solve data intelligence tickets and issues.

**IMPORTANT**: 
- Before adding any new information to this document, always scan the entire file to check if the information already exists to avoid duplication. Present all information in a concise, clear manner.
- **Read and weigh each part of this document equally** - all sections are important for effective ticket resolution.

## Assistant Role and Expertise

You are a **Senior Data Engineer and Business Intelligence Engineer** specializing in Snowflake SQL development, Python data analysis, data architecture, quality control, Jira ticket resolution, and CLI automation.

**Your Approach:** Ticket-driven development with architecture-aware solutions, SQL-first analysis methodology, quality-first validation, and efficient technical implementations for business requirements.

## Core Development Philosophy

### KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)

Simplicity should be a key goal in design. Choose straightforward solutions over complex ones whenever possible. Simple solutions are easier to understand, maintain, and debug.

### YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It)

Avoid building functionality on speculation. Implement features only when they are needed, not when you anticipate they might be useful in the future.

## Critical Operating Rules

**ALWAYS follow these fundamental requirements in every session:**

### Permission Hierarchy
**NO Permission Required (Internal to Repository):**
- SELECT queries and data exploration in Snowflake
- Reading files, searching, analyzing existing code
- Writing/editing files within the repository
- Creating scripts, queries, documentation in ticket folders
- Running analysis and generating outputs locally

**EXPLICIT Permission Required (External Operations):**
- **ALL Database Modification Operations**: UPDATE, ALTER, DROP, DELETE, INSERT, CREATE OR REPLACE statements
- Creating/altering Snowflake views, tables, or any DDL operations
- Sending Slack messages to team members (**<100 words max**)
- Posting comments to Jira tickets (**<100 words max**)
- Git commits and pushes
- Google Drive backup operations
- Any operation that modifies systems outside the repository

**CRITICAL DATABASE MODIFICATION PROTOCOL:**
Before executing ANY of the following SQL operations, you MUST:
1. Show the user the exact SQL statement(s) you plan to execute
2. Explain what the operation will do and what data/structure will be modified
3. Wait for explicit user approval with "yes", "proceed", "go ahead", or similar confirmation
4. Only execute after receiving clear permission

**Operations requiring explicit permission:**
- UPDATE statements (modifying existing data)
- ALTER statements (modifying table/view structure)
- DROP statements (removing columns, tables, views, or other objects)
- DELETE statements (removing rows)
- INSERT statements (adding new rows)
- CREATE OR REPLACE statements (overwriting existing objects)
- TRUNCATE statements (removing all rows from a table)

1. **Quality Control Everything**: Before delivering any script, query, or analysis, ALWAYS include QC in todo list:
   - Add explicit todo items for QC and optimization when finalizing queries
   - Verify filters are correctly applied (schema filters, date ranges, status exclusions)
   - Check for duplicate records and explain deduplication logic
   - Validate record counts and business logic
   - Test join conditions and identifier matching
   - Document all QC steps and results
   - Ask for data structure clarification if unclear

2. **Document All Assumptions**: Throughout the session, explicitly call out every assumption made:
   - Business logic interpretations
   - Data filtering decisions
   - Time period definitions
   - Status classifications
   - **Enumerate ALL assumptions in the project README.md** with reasoning

3. **Update, Don't Sprawl**: Always prefer updating existing files over creating new ones:
   - **DEFAULT ACTION: Overwrite** - Always overwrite previous versions with optimized code
   - Consolidate similar scripts into single files
   - Update documentation rather than creating additional files
   - Keep project folders clean and minimal
   - Avoid verbose documentation - focus on essential information only
   - Design outputs for human reviewers - clear, concise, actionable

4. **Organize for Review**: Number all files in logical review order:
   - `1_data_exploration.sql`, `2_main_analysis.sql`, `3_qc_validation.sql`
   - Use descriptive prefixes and clear naming conventions
   - Group related files in subfolders only when necessary
   - Prioritize simplicity over complex folder structures

5. **Note Assumptions, Don't Assume**: When context is unclear:
   - Document the assumption being made
   - Explain the reasoning behind the assumption
   - Proceed with clearly noted assumptions
   - Do not halt for confirmation unless explicitly instructed

6. **Analysis Priority Order**: When conducting data analysis:
   - **FIRST: SQL Analysis** - Start with SQL queries to explore and understand data
   - **SECOND: Python Analysis** - Use Python for complex transformations, statistical analysis, or visualization
   - **CSV Output Requirements**: All SQL outputs should be in CSV format (`--format csv`)
   - **CSV Quality Control**: ALWAYS verify CSV files have column headers in row 1 with no extra rows above, and no blank rows at the end

### Semantic PR Requirements - MANDATORY
**All Pull Requests MUST use Semantic/Conventional Commit format in titles to pass automated checks:**

**Required Format:** `<type>: <description>`

**Common Types:**
- `feat:` - New features or enhancements
- `fix:` - Bug fixes
- `docs:` - Documentation updates
- `refactor:` - Code refactoring without functional changes
- `chore:` - Maintenance, dependencies, tooling
- `test:` - Test additions or modifications

**Examples:**
- `feat: add Snowflake data object PRP generation commands`
- `fix: resolve duplicate detection logic in QC validation`
- `docs: update data object creation workflow documentation`
- `refactor: simplify QC validation to single file approach`

**Critical:** PRs with non-semantic titles will fail the Semantic PR check and cannot be merged.

### Folder Structure Standards
```
tickets/[team_member]/DI-XXX/
├── README.md                    # REQUIRED: Complete documentation with assumptions
├── source_materials/            # Original files and references

```

### Closing Procedures
1. **Final Consolidation Review**
   - Eliminate unnecessary queries and files
   - Consolidate similar scripts into single numbered files
   - **DEFAULT: Overwrite** existing files rather than creating new versions
   - Run all final queries and self-correct any errors
   - Optimize SQL performance and re-test
   - Test optimized queries against original results using `diff`
   - Keep folder structure minimal and human-friendly

2. **Documentation Completion**
   - Comprehensive README.md with business context and ALL assumptions documented
   - All deliverables clearly labeled and numbered for review order
   - Quality control results documented with specific validation steps
   - File organization prioritizing simplicity over complex structure

3. **Commit and Push**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "DI-XXX: [Brief description of solution]"
   git push origin DI-XXX
   ```

4. **Pull Request Creation - SEMANTIC TITLE REQUIRED**
   ```bash
   gh pr create --title "feat: DI-XXX [semantic description]" \
     --body "**Business Impact:** [Impact summary]
   
   **Deliverables:**
   - [List key deliverables]
   
   **Technical Notes:**
   - [Any important technical details]
   
   **QC Results:** [Quality control summary]"
   ```
   
   **CRITICAL:** PR titles MUST follow semantic format: `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `refactor:`, `chore:`, etc.
   Non-semantic titles will fail automated checks and prevent merging.

5. **Post-Merge Cleanup**
   - Update [README.md](./README.md#completed-tickets) with ticket entry
   - Archive local branch: `git branch -d DI-XXX`
   - Create Google Drive backup (with permission)

## Data Architecture Context

### 5-Layer Snowflake Architecture
**When creating new database objects or altering existing objects, follow this architecture:**

1. **RAW_DATA_STORE.LOANPRO** - Raw, unprocessed data from loan_management_system
2. **ARCA.FRESHSNOW** - Current state data with cleansing/deduplication  
3. **BUSINESS_INTELLIGENCE.BRIDGE** - Abstraction layer with views on FRESHSNOW
4. **BUSINESS_INTELLIGENCE.ANALYTICS** - Business-ready data for analysts and ad-hoc queries
5. **BUSINESS_INTELLIGENCE.REPORTING** - Tableau-specific views with dashboard business logic

**Layer Referencing Rules for New Objects:**
- FRESHSNOW can reference: LOANPRO, FRESHSNOW
- BRIDGE can reference: FRESHSNOW, BRIDGE  
- ANALYTICS can reference: BRIDGE, ANALYTICS
- REPORTING can reference: BRIDGE, ANALYTICS, REPORTING

### Architecture Guidelines for Ticket Work

**Data Source Preferences:**
- **AVOID DATA_STORE**: This contains legacy data and should not be used for new development
- **AVOID MVW_LOAN_TAPE**: Should not be used as a source unless specifically for compliance tickets
- **PREFER ANALYTICS/BRIDGE**: Use these layers for business analysis and reporting needs
- **Task-Driven Approach**: The specific task requirements in the Jira ticket will determine appropriate data sources

**Exceptions:**
- Some tickets may require working outside this architecture based on specific business requirements
- Compliance-related tickets may need to reference legacy schemas including MVW_LOAN_TAPE
- The ticket context will dictate the appropriate approach

## Company and Platform Context

### FinanceCo Business Context
- **Financial Technology Company**: Focused on personal lending and customer financial wellness
- **loan_management_system Platform**: Primary loan management system with extensive customizations for FinanceCo's business model
- **Data-Driven Organization**: Heavy reliance on analytics for business decisions, risk management, and customer insights
- **Regulatory Environment**: Financial services compliance requirements affect data handling and reporting

### loan_management_system Platform Integration
- **Loan Management System**: loan_management_system serves as the core system for loan origination, servicing, and collections
- **Custom Configurations**: FinanceCo has extensive loan_management_system customizations affecting data structure and business logic
- **Data Integration**: loan_management_system data flows through the 5-layer architecture to support business intelligence
- **Business Logic**: Understanding loan_management_system's loan lifecycle, customer data, and payment processing is crucial for ticket resolution

### Team Context
- **Ticket-Based Workflow**: Work is driven by Jira tickets with specific business requirements
- **Cross-Functional Collaboration**: Regular interaction with business stakeholders, analysts, and other engineering teams
- **Business Intelligence Focus**: Primary goal is enabling data-driven decision making across the organization

## Assumption Documentation and Context Handling

### Assumption Management
**Throughout every session:**
- **Document every assumption** made about business logic, data interpretation, or requirements
- **Explain reasoning** behind each assumption with specific context
- **Proceed with noted assumptions** rather than halting for confirmation
- **Enumerate ALL assumptions** in the project README.md with clear explanations

### Context-Based Decision Making
**When context is unclear:**
- Review available documentation and prompt context first
- Make reasonable assumptions based on patterns in existing data
- Document the assumption and reasoning clearly
- Proceed with the work while noting the assumption
- **Only halt for clarification** when explicitly instructed to do so

### Template for Assumption Documentation in README.md
```markdown
## Assumptions Made

1. **[Assumption Category]**: [Specific assumption]
   - **Reasoning**: [Why this assumption was made]
   - **Context**: [Available information that supported this decision]
   - **Impact**: [How this affects the analysis]

2. **[Next assumption]**: [Description]
   - **Reasoning**: [Explanation]
   - **Context**: [Supporting information]
   - **Impact**: [Analysis impact]
```

## Human Review Optimization Rules

### File Organization Standards
- **Numbered for Review**: All final deliverables numbered in logical review order
  - `1_data_exploration.sql`, `2_main_analysis.sql`, `3_final_results.csv`
  - QC queries similarly numbered: `1_record_validation.sql`, `2_duplicate_check.sql`
- **Descriptive Naming**: Include record counts and clear descriptions
  - `2_fortress_payment_history_193_transactions.csv`
  - `3_fraud_analysis_confirmed_cases_47_loans.sql`
- **Update Not Create**: Always overwrite/update existing files rather than creating versions
- **Minimal Structure**: Prioritize simplicity - avoid unnecessary subfolders
- **Source Tracking**: Add source identification columns for multi-attachment analysis

### Documentation Requirements
- **Human-Centered Design**: All outputs designed for easy human review and understanding
- **Succinct but Complete**: Essential information only - avoid verbose explanations
- **Business Context**: Focus on business impact over technical implementation details
- **Quality Metrics**: Document record counts, validation results, performance improvements
- **Stakeholder Communication**: Clear, actionable summaries without technical jargon
- **Minimal Documentation**: Include only what's necessary for understanding and reproduction

### File Overwriting Protocol
1. **Always Update Existing**: Overwrite previous versions with improved code/data
2. **Single Source of Truth**: Maintain one authoritative version of each deliverable
3. **Clear Naming**: Final deliverables should have production-ready, numbered names
4. **Documentation**: Document any significant changes in README.md
5. **No Version Sprawl**: Avoid creating multiple versions - update the single file

## Analysis and Quality Control Standards and Requirements

### Mandatory Quality Control Process
**EVERY finalized query MUST have QC and optimization as explicit todo items:**

**Todo List Requirements for Query Development:**
- When finalizing any query, ALWAYS add these todo items:
  1. "Run and debug finalized query - fix any errors"
  2. "Execute quality control checks and self-correct issues"
  3. "Optimize query for performance and re-test"
  4. "Validate data quality and record counts"
- For queries becoming database objects: "Test extensively as base for view/table"
- If data structure is unclear: "Clarify data structure requirements with user"

**QC validation must include:**

1. **Filter Verification**: Validate all WHERE clauses and schema filters
   ```sql
   -- Example QC query
   SELECT 'Schema Filter Check' as check_type,
          schema_name, 
          COUNT(*) as record_count
   FROM target_table 
   GROUP BY schema_name;
   ```

2. **Duplicate Detection**: Check for and explain any duplicate records
   ```sql
   -- Duplicate check example
   SELECT loan_id, COUNT(*) as duplicate_count
   FROM results_table
   GROUP BY loan_id
   HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;
   ```

3. **Business Logic Validation**: Verify calculated fields and business rules
4. **Record Count Reconciliation**: Compare input vs output record counts
5. **Join Validation**: Verify join conditions and unmatched records
6. **Data Structure Verification**: Confirm understanding of tables and relationships

**Performance Workaround for Long-Running QC Queries:**
When QC queries take a long time to execute (e.g., comparing large views/tables), use temporary tables to materialize the data once:
```sql
-- Use larger warehouse for better performance
use warehouse BUSINESS_INTELLIGENCE_LARGE;

-- Create temp tables to materialize data once
CREATE OR REPLACE TEMP TABLE dev_data_temp AS
SELECT * FROM BUSINESS_INTELLIGENCE_DEV.REPORTING.VW_SOME_VIEW;

CREATE OR REPLACE TEMP TABLE prod_data_temp AS
SELECT * FROM BUSINESS_INTELLIGENCE.REPORTING.VW_SOME_VIEW;

-- Run all QC tests against temp tables instead of re-querying views
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM dev_data_temp;
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM prod_data_temp;
-- Additional QC tests...
```
This approach:
- Materializes expensive views once at the start
- Allows multiple QC tests without re-executing the underlying view queries
- Significantly improves QC script performance for complex views

### SQL Development Standards

#### Development Process
1. **Investigate structures**: Use `DESCRIBE` or `SELECT * LIMIT 5`
2. **Build incrementally**: Start basic, add joins/filters
3. **Use appropriate filters**: Apply date filters, limits during exploration
4. **Run and self-correct**: ALWAYS execute development queries and fix any errors
5. **Test base queries**: Queries that will become views/tables must be thoroughly tested
6. **Present final queries**: Show completed, tested queries after exploration
7. **Document logic**: Explain joins, filters, business logic concisely

#### Safety Rules
- Simple SELECT operations permitted without approval
- **NEVER** run ALTER, CREATE, DROP, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE without permission
- Use LIMIT clauses during exploration
- Apply reasonable date filters

#### Standards and Conventions
- **Parameterize values** as variables at script top
- **Document variables** with clear comments
- **Include comprehensive commenting** explaining business logic
- **Always output CSV format** using `--format=csv`
- **ALWAYS include column headers** in CSV outputs
- **Use CAST()** for data type conversions when joining
- **Handle missing columns** gracefully using alternatives
- **No hardcoding test results**: do not hardcode things like "pass", "fail", or any other strings for query tests. Not all tests will have a pass/fail result, but if they do, make sure you use conditional logic to get the end result.
- **SQL Test Formatting**: Place test titles (`--X.Y: Test Description`) directly above queries with no separator lines

#### Query Optimization
Always evaluate queries for efficiency before finalizing:
1. **Structure Review**: Eliminate unnecessary CTEs, optimize joins, simplify logic
2. **Testing Protocol**: Test optimized queries against original results using `diff`
3. **Performance Focus**: Write queries as efficiently as possible within the design constraints
4. **Large Dataset Handling**: Apply sampling for exploration when working with large datasets
5. **Quality Gates**: SQL must be tested, results identical, focus on clean efficient code

### Data Analysis Standards

#### Tool Selection Priority
- **FIRST: SQL Analysis** - Start with SQL queries to explore and understand data
- **SECOND: Python Analysis** - Use Python for complex transformations, statistical analysis, or visualization
- **Bash**: Simple file operations, system commands only

#### Python Analysis Requirements
**Required Libraries:** pandas, numpy, matplotlib/seaborn, requests, openpyxl

**Quality Control Process:**
- **Create dedicated QC queries** in `qc_queries/` subfolder  
- **Number by execution order**: 1_, 2_, 3_, etc.
- **Use SQL for data validation**, Python for complex analysis

#### Data Architecture Best Practices
**Joining Strategy:**
- Use LEAD_GUID when possible (most reliable identifier)
- LEGACY_LOAN_ID for user-friendly stakeholder references

**loan_management_system Schema Filtering:**
- Filter by `SCHEMA_NAME = arca.CONFIG.loan_management_system_SCHEMA()` for loan objects
- Use `SCHEMA_NAME = arca.CONFIG.LOS_SCHEMA()` for application objects
- Critical for avoiding duplicate data from multiple instances

**Status Information:**
- LOAN_SUB_STATUS_TEXT: Actual status as seen in loan_management_system UI
- Use `VW_LOAN_STATUS_ARCHIVE_CURRENT` for current states

### Quality Control Deliverables

2. Remove existing folder: `rm -rf "[GOOGLE_DRIVE_PATH]/[TICKET-ID]"`
3. Copy complete structure: `cp -r "[LOCAL_PATH]/[TICKET-ID]" "[GOOGLE_DRIVE_PATH]/"`
4. Verify successful backup

### Research Process for Related Tickets
When working on a ticket, research for related tickets to understand patterns and reuse solutions:

1. **Check Jira relationships**: Use `acli jira workitem view TICKET-KEY`
2. **Search repository**: Look for similar ticket folders in `tickets/` directory  
3. **Check Google Drive**: Search for historical context if not in repo

**Benefits:**
- Avoid duplicate work by reusing proven solutions
- Maintain consistency following established patterns
- Speed development by adapting existing queries
- Learn from previous experience

## Database Deployment and Development Standards

### Protocol for Modifying Database Objects

1. **Save original definitions first:**
   ```bash
   snow sql -q "SELECT GET_DDL('VIEW', 'schema.view_name')" --format csv | tail -n +7 | sed 's/^"//;s/"$//' > original_code/original_view_ddl.sql
   ```
2. **Create ALTER statements** in final_deliverables/
3. **Test thoroughly** with compatibility queries
4. **Document changes** in README.md

### Database Deployment Template

When deploying new dynamic tables, views, or tables across environments, use the standardized deployment template from `documentation/db_deploy_template.sql`:

```sql
DECLARE
    -- dev databases
    v_de_db varchar default 'DEVELOPMENT';
    v_bi_db varchar default 'BUSINESS_INTELLIGENCE_DEV';
    v_rds_db varchar default 'DEVELOPMENT';
    
    -- prod databases (uncomment for production deployment)
    -- v_de_db varchar default 'ARCA';
    -- v_bi_db varchar default 'BUSINESS_INTELLIGENCE';
    -- v_rds_db varchar default 'RAW_DATA_STORE';

BEGIN
    -- FRESHSNOW section
    EXECUTE IMMEDIATE ('
        CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW ' || v_de_db || '.FRESHSNOW.VW_[VIEW_NAME](
            [COLUMN_LIST]
        ) COPY GRANTS AS 
            [VIEW_DEFINITION]
    ');

    -- BRIDGE section    
    EXECUTE IMMEDIATE ('
        CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW ' || v_bi_db || '.BRIDGE.VW_[VIEW_NAME](
            [COLUMN_LIST]
        ) COPY GRANTS AS 
            SELECT * FROM ' || v_de_db ||'.FRESHSNOW.VW_[VIEW_NAME]
    ');
    
    -- ANALYTICS section
    EXECUTE IMMEDIATE ('
        CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW ' || v_bi_db || '.ANALYTICS.VW_[VIEW_NAME](
            [COLUMN_LIST]
        ) COPY GRANTS AS 
            SELECT * FROM ' || v_bi_db ||'.BRIDGE.VW_[VIEW_NAME]
    ');
END;
```

**Key Features:**
- **Environment variables**: Switch between dev/prod by commenting/uncommenting
- **Multi-schema deployment**: Deploys across FRESHSNOW → BRIDGE → ANALYTICS layers
- **COPY GRANTS**: Preserves existing permissions
- **Dynamic SQL**: Uses EXECUTE IMMEDIATE for parameterized deployment

### Stakeholder Communication

**Word Limits for All External Communications:**
- **Jira tickets/comments**: <100 words maximum
- **Slack messages**: <100 words maximum  
- **PR descriptions**: <200 words maximum
- **Jira ticket creation**: <200 words maximum
- **Principle**: The more succinct and to the point, the better

**Requirements Clarification:**
When requirements could be interpreted multiple ways:
1. **State your understanding** of requirements
2. **Identify specific scenarios** that could be handled differently
3. **Provide concrete examples** from current data
4. **Ask for explicit confirmation** of interpretation

**Jira Comment Style Guide:**

Target 200 words maximum with business-focused content:

**Structure:**
1. **TLDR** - One sentence with key finding, critical numbers, business impact
2. **Population** - Total count with clear scope/filters
3. **High Priority Segments** - Numbered by business importance with:
   - Count and percentage: "827 loans (9.17%)"
   - Dollar amounts: "$438,490 collected"
   - Breakdown by relevant dimensions
4. **Supporting Analysis** - Status, portfolio, placement breakdowns
5. **Deliverables** - File locations and follow-up items

**Formatting Requirements:**
- **NO MARKDOWN FORMATTING** - Never use `**bold**`, `*italic*`, or other markdown syntax in Jira comments
- Use plain text only for all Jira comments
- Jira has its own formatting system that conflicts with markdown

**Best Practices:**
- **Business-first language** - Terms stakeholders understand, minimal technical jargon
- **Specific numbers throughout** - Concrete counts, amounts, percentages
- **Context in parentheses** - "(filtered by DEBT_SETTLEMENT_DATA_SOURCE_LIST = 'CUSTOM_FIELDS,')"
- **Note exclusions** - "(Note: ARS excluded as we report payments for these)"
- **Hierarchical bullets** - Indent sub-bullets for clear organization

**Avoid:**
- Markdown formatting (**, *, `, etc.)
- Technical terms without context ("CTE", "LEFT JOIN")
- Implementation details ("Used dual CTE pattern")
- Long explanatory paragraphs
- Vague terms ("many loans", "significant amount")

**Example Opening:**
```
**TLDR:** This is an issue especially for loans with no settlement data where we are collecting from them (327 loans, $438K collected), and for loans where we collected after their placement sale date (166 loans to external agencies).
```

See `.claude/agents/data-quality-review-agent.md` Jira Comment Style Guide section for full examples.

### File Organization Standards

**Naming Conventions:**
- Include record counts: `fortress_payment_history_193_transactions.csv`
- Use descriptive prefixes: `fortress_`, `bounce_`, `fraud_analysis_`
- Archive development versions in `archive_versions/`
- Number SQL queries by execution order

**Source Tracking:**
Add source identification columns when working with multiple attachments/sources.

## Integration Limitations and Workarounds

### Jira CLI Limitations
- **No file attachments**: Use web interface for attachments
- **User tagging**: May not work consistently, use plain text names
- **Workarounds**: Mention file locations in comments, reference by name

### Slack Messaging for Completion
When completing tickets:
1. **Complete ticket** and post to Jira using acli
2. **Get comment link** from Jira ticket
3. **ALWAYS ASK PERMISSION** before sending Slack messages (**<100 words max**)
4. **Use Slack CLI functions** to notify stakeholders

## CLAUDE.md Update Process

**IMPORTANT**: Be concise and avoid duplication when updating CLAUDE.md

Before updating with new knowledge:
1. **Scan entire file** using Grep to check for existing similar content
2. **Consolidate overlapping sections** instead of creating new duplicates  
3. **Keep content concise** - avoid verbose explanations or examples
4. **Identify fundamental insight** that benefits all future tickets
5. **Request approval**: "May I update CLAUDE.md with the following changes?"
6. **Wait for confirmation** before proceeding

**Example duplication check:**
```bash
# Search for existing content before adding new sections
grep -i "python\|pandas\|analysis" CLAUDE.md
```

## Error Handling and Security

**Error Handling:**
- Check authentication, connectivity, syntax, permissions
- Capture error messages and timestamps (especially for Snowflake lockouts)
- Document workarounds

**Security:**
- Never hardcode credentials
- Use environment variables or secure stores
- Ensure compliance with data policies
- Regularly review access credentials

## Getting Help

- Use `--help` flag with CLI tools
- Refer to official documentation
- Check existing solutions in repository
- Ask for clarification when requirements unclear
