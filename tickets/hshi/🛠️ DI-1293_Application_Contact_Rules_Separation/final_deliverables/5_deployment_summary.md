## Testing Results

### Pre-Deployment Testing
✅ View creation verified
✅ Column structure validated
✅ Row counts confirmed
✅ DI-986 suppressions tested
✅ Collections jobs verified (BI-2482 unchanged)

### Post-Deployment Validation
✅ DI-986 ran successfully in production
✅ No job failures
✅ Suppression counts as expected
✅ Collections jobs unaffected

## Changes Summary

### Application-Level Campaigns (3 updated)
✅ Email Non-Opener SMS → VW_APP_CONTACT_RULES
✅ Allocated Capital Partner → VW_APP_CONTACT_RULES
✅ SMS Funnel Communication → VW_APP_CONTACT_RULES

### Loan-Level Campaigns (3 fixed)
✅ AutoPaySMS → Fixed to use VW_LOAN pattern (prevented breakage)
✅ PIF Email → Simplified + fixed SUPPRESS_EMAIL flag
✅ 6M to PIF Email → Simplified + fixed SUPPRESS_EMAIL flag

### Suppressions Removed (1)
✅ Prescreen Email DNC: Email → Removed (application-level has no email suppression yet)

## Issues Resolved

1. ✅ Separated application and loan contact rules (DI-1258 architecture decision)
2. ✅ Fixed AutoPaySMS breakage (was using removed application_guid column)
3. ✅ Fixed PIF email campaigns checking wrong suppression flags
4. ✅ Removed invalid Prescreen Email suppression
5. ✅ Added proper WHERE clauses to all application suppressions
6. ✅ Simplified loan-level patterns (removed unnecessary VW_APPLICATION joins)

## Monitoring

### Jobs to Monitor
- DI-986_Outbound_List_Generation_for_Funnel (daily)
- BI-2482_Outbound_List_Generation_for_GR (daily)

### Metrics to Track
- Suppression counts in RPT_OUTBOUND_LISTS_SUPPRESSION
- Campaign list sizes (should be consistent with historical baselines)
- Job execution times (should be similar or improved)

## Rollback Plan

If issues arise:

1. **Revert views:**
   ```sql
   -- Restore original VW_LOAN_CONTACT_RULES with sms_consent CTE
   -- Drop VW_APP_CONTACT_RULES
   ```

2. **Revert DI-986:**
   - Checkout previous commit before DI-1293 changes
   - Redeploy job

3. **Estimated rollback time:** < 15 minutes

## Success Metrics

✅ No job failures post-deployment
✅ Suppression logic working correctly for all campaigns
✅ Collections jobs continue operating normally
✅ Clean separation of application vs. loan contact rules
✅ Improved code maintainability and clarity

## Future Enhancements

1. **Add email suppression to VW_APP_CONTACT_RULES** - Will enable proper Prescreen Email DNC suppression
2. **Monitor for additional application-level suppression needs** - Phone, letter suppressions
3. **Consider consolidating other mixed-context suppressions** - Apply same pattern to other areas if found
