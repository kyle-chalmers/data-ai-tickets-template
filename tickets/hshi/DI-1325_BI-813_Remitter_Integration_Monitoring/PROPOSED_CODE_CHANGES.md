**File**: `business-intelligence-data-jobs/jobs/BI-813_Remitter_Rewrite/BI_813_Remitter_Rewrite.py`

**Code to Delete**:

```python
## Email for exceptions
query = """
    with EXCEPTION as (select PAYOFFUID
                      from PII.RPT_REMITTER_UPLOADFILE_HIST
                      where ASOFDATE = (select max(SUB.ASOFDATE) from PII.RPT_REMITTER_UPLOADFILE_HIST as SUB)
                        and STATUS like '%void%'
                      except
                      select PAYOFFUID
                      from CRON_STORE.RPT_REMITTER_INVENTORY_HIST
                      where STATUS like '%Void%'
                        and ASOFDATE = '{0}')
    select *
    from CRON_STORE.RPT_REMITTER_INVENTORY_HIST
    where PAYOFFUID in (select * from EXCEPTION)
      and ASOFDATE = '{1}'
    """.format(file_date, file_date)

query_construct = (spark
                   .read
                   .format('snowflake')
                   .options(**sf_options)
                   .option('query', query)
                   .load())

df = query_construct.toPandas()

if df.shape[0] != 0:
    sender = 'biteam@happymoney.com'
    recipients = ['biteam@happymoney.com']
    email_subject = 'Exception in Remitter Inventory Report'
    email_body = df.to_html(index=False)
    send_email(sender, recipients, email_subject, email_body)
```

**Replacement**: None - simply delete this entire section

---

## Rationale

This alert is non-functional because:
1. Compares stale 2023 data against current 2025 data
2. The table `PII.RPT_REMITTER_UPLOADFILE_HIST` hasn't been updated since 2023-12-15
3. Current job never sends void status (hardcoded as "awaiting payment")
4. Alert serves no functional purpose and causes confusion
