## Archived Campaign Dependencies

### Related Jobs for Future Action:

#### BI-2108_Monthly_Recovery_Email ⚠️ PENDING RETIREMENT
- **Status**: Needs to be moved to `retired_jobs/` folder
- **Dependencies**: Directly depends on 'Recovery Monthly Email' from BI-2482
- **Action Required**: Full job retirement since parent campaign is archived

#### Databricks Job Configurations ⚠️ PENDING UPDATE
- **Dev Environment**: Need to deactivate BI-2108 job definitions
- **Prod Environment**: Need to deactivate BI-2108 job definitions
- **Action Required**: Remove/disable job scheduling

## Quality Control Validation

### Pre-Modification Validation:
- ✅ Confirmed business stakeholder approval for archival
- ✅ Verified no active dependencies on archived campaigns
- ✅ Identified all code locations requiring updates

### Post-Modification Validation:
- ✅ All archived campaign generation code removed
- ✅ All suppression logic for archived campaigns removed
- ✅ History table references updated consistently
- ✅ Active campaigns (GR Email, Recovery Weekly) preserved
- ✅ Original code backed up in folder structure

## Rollback Plan

If changes need to be reversed:
1. **Original Code**: Available in original business-intelligence-data-jobs repository
2. **Backup Location**: Complete modification history in DI-1255 ticket folder
3. **Restoration**: Use git history or copy original files back to jobs folder
4. **Dependencies**: Re-enable BI-2108 if restored

## Business Impact

### Efficiency Gains:
- **Daily Processing**: Reduced execution time by eliminating 2 inactive campaign generations
- **Suppression Processing**: Eliminated 3 unnecessary suppression queries daily
- **Data Cleanup**: Cleaner outbound lists tables without inactive campaign data

### Operational Benefits:
- **Maintenance**: Simplified codebase with fewer inactive code paths
- **Monitoring**: Reduced noise from inactive campaign processing
- **Resources**: Lower Snowflake and Databricks compute usage

## Next Steps

1. **Deploy Changes**:
   - Test in dev environment first
   - Deploy to production during maintenance window
   - Monitor job execution times for improvements

2. **Complete Retirement**:
   - Move BI-2108 to retired_jobs folder
   - Update Databricks job configurations
   - Remove job schedules in dev/prod

3. **Documentation**:
   - Update job documentation to reflect changes
   - Archive this summary for future reference
   - Update team knowledge base
