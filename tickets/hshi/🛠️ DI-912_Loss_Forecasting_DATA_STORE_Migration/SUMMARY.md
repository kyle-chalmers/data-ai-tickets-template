# DI-912: Summary and Next Steps

## Executive Summary

**Status**: ✅ **MIGRATION READY - HYBRID APPROACH**
**Solution**: Combine DATA_STORE legacy data (337K loans) with current ANALYTICS/BRIDGE sources (12K+ new loans)
**Impact**: 100% data coverage maintained + improved autopay tracking (+9,722 records)

## What Was Done

1. ✅ **Analyzed BI-1451 Loss Forecasting job** - Identified 3 DATA_STORE dependencies
2. ✅ **Researched ANALYTICS/BRIDGE alternatives** - Found equivalent tables in current architecture
3. ✅ **Created migration plan** - Documented proposed replacement queries
4. ✅ **Ran QC validation queries** - Discovered DATA_STORE is static (not updated with new loans)
5. ✅ **Found VW_LMS_CUSTOM_LOAN_SETTINGS_CURRENT** - Correct autopay source (numeric 1/0, not 'yes'/'no')
6. ✅ **Developed HYBRID approach** - Combine legacy DATA_STORE with current ANALYTICS/BRIDGE
7. ✅ **Validated hybrid coverage** - Confirmed 350K+ total loans with improved metrics

## Critical Finding & Solution

**Problem**: DATA_STORE.VW_LOAN_COLLECTION is **static** - contains 337K legacy loans but is not updated with new loans.

**Solution**: HYBRID approach using UNION of legacy + current data sources.

### Hybrid Coverage Results

| Source | Record Count | Cease & Desist | Bankruptcy | Autopay |
|--------|--------------|----------------|------------|---------|
| **DATA_STORE** (legacy) | 337,219 | 20,650 | 6,633 | 214,590 |
| **ANALYTICS/BRIDGE** (new only) | 12,792 | 9 | 4 | 9,722 |
| **TOTAL HYBRID** | **350,011** | **20,659** | **6,637** | **224,312** |

**Conclusion**: Hybrid approach maintains 100% data coverage + adds new LoanPro loans.

2. **SUMMARY.md** - Executive summary and next steps (this file)
3. **exploratory_analysis/data_quality_findings.md** - Detailed analysis with query results
4. **final_deliverables/1_validate_analytics_tables.sql** - QC queries to verify table coverage
5. **final_deliverables/2_compare_old_vs_new_pattern.sql** - Comparison queries
6. **final_deliverables/3_updated_BI-1451_dist_auto_cte.py** - Pure ANALYTICS approach (NOT RECOMMENDED - data loss)
7. **final_deliverables/4_hybrid_migration_strategy.md** - **RECOMMENDED APPROACH** - Complete hybrid documentation
8. **final_deliverables/5_hybrid_dist_auto_cte_RECOMMENDED.py** - **RECOMMENDED CODE** - Hybrid implementation

## Key Discoveries ✅

1. **✅ Autopay source identified**: `BRIDGE.VW_LMS_CUSTOM_LOAN_SETTINGS_CURRENT.AUTOPAY_OPT_IN = 1` (numeric, not 'yes'/'no')
   - Much better coverage than VW_LOS_CUSTOM_LOAN_SETTINGS_CURRENT
   - Provides 70K+ current autopay records

2. **✅ DATA_STORE is static**: Not updated with new loans (last update unknown)
   - Contains 337K legacy loans
   - Missing 12K+ new LoanPro loans

3. **✅ Hybrid approach solves the problem**:
   - Combine DATA_STORE legacy data with ANALYTICS/BRIDGE current data
   - Maintains 100% coverage + adds new loans
   - No business logic disruption

## Recommended Next Steps

### Immediate (Ready to Implement)
1. ✅ **Review hybrid implementation code** (`5_hybrid_dist_auto_cte_RECOMMENDED.py`)
2. ✅ **Test in dev environment** using production database connections
3. ✅ **Validate hybrid query results**:
   - Total records: 350K+ (vs 337K old)
   - No duplicate PAYOFF_UIDs
   - Flag counts match or exceed old pattern

### Short Term (Next 1-2 Weeks)
4. **Deploy hybrid approach to production**:
   - Update BI-1451_Loss_Forecasting.py with hybrid dist_auto CTE
   - Monitor first production run
   - Compare output table (DSH_LOAN_PORTFOLIO_EXPECTATIONS) before/after
   - Validate forecasting metrics remain consistent

5. **Document hybrid approach** in job's claude.md file

### Long Term (Future Migration)
6. **Monitor DATA_STORE staleness**:
   - Track how many new loans are in LoanPro but not DATA_STORE
   - Determine when DATA_STORE becomes significantly outdated

7. **Plan Phase 2 migration** when historical data is backfilled:
   - Remove DATA_STORE CTE from hybrid query
   - Use only ANALYTICS/BRIDGE sources
   - Requires all historical data in ANALYTICS tables

8. **Create ANALYTICS.VW_LOAN_MONTHLY_SNAPSHOT** to replace MVW_LOAN_TAPE_MONTHLY

## Risk Assessment

**Hybrid Approach (RECOMMENDED)**:
- ✅ **No data loss** - Maintains all 337K legacy loans
- ✅ **Improved coverage** - Adds 12K+ new LoanPro loans
- ✅ **Business continuity** - Forecasting model gets complete dataset
- ✅ **Architecture compliance** - Uses ANALYTICS/BRIDGE for new data
- ⚠️ **Complexity** - UNION query slightly more complex than single source
- ⚠️ **Future work** - Needs Phase 2 migration when historical data is backfilled
- ✅ **Low risk** - Tested and validated coverage

**Pure ANALYTICS Approach (NOT RECOMMENDED)**:
- ❌ **87% cease & desist loss** (20,650 → 2,650)
- ❌ **66% bankruptcy loss** (6,633 → 2,272)
- ❌ **67% autopay loss** (214,590 → 70,265)
- ❌ **High risk** - Would break forecasting business logic

## Recommendation

**✅ PROCEED with HYBRID approach** as documented in `5_hybrid_dist_auto_cte_RECOMMENDED.py`

This approach provides the best balance of:
- ✅ Business continuity (no data loss)
- ✅ Architecture improvement (uses ANALYTICS for new data)
- ✅ Risk mitigation (maintains historical data)
- ✅ Future flexibility (clear path to full ANALYTICS migration)
