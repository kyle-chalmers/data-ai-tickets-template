DI-912: HYBRID dist_auto CTE for BI-1451 Loss Forecasting - RECOMMENDED APPROACH
Purpose: Combine DATA_STORE legacy data with current ANALYTICS/BRIDGE sources
Author: Hongxia Shi
Date: 2025-10-01

CHANGES REQUIRED:
- File: /Users/hshi/WOW/business-intelligence-data-jobs/jobs/BI-1451_Loss_Forecasting/BI-1451_Loss_Forecasting.py
- Lines: 574-581 (dist_auto CTE definition)

STRATEGY:
- Use UNION to combine legacy DATA_STORE.VW_LOAN_COLLECTION (337K loans)
  with current ANALYTICS/BRIDGE sources (12K+ new loans)
- Maintains 100% data coverage with no loss
- Improves autopay coverage from 214K to 224K

# ============================================================================
# KEY DIFFERENCES FROM ORIGINAL
# ============================================================================
# 1. UNION Structure: Combines two data sources instead of single DATA_STORE query
# 2. Legacy Data Preserved: Maintains all 337K historical loans from DATA_STORE
# 3. Current Data Added: Includes 12K+ new LoanPro loans not in DATA_STORE
# 4. Data Transformations:
#    - Legacy: 'Y'/'N' strings → TRUE/FALSE booleans
#    - Legacy: 'Ach On'/'Off' → TRUE/FALSE booleans
#    - Current: Numeric 1/0 → TRUE/FALSE booleans (VW_LMS.AUTOPAY_OPT_IN)
# 5. Table Sources for Current Loans:
#    - CEASE_AND_DESIST: VW_LOAN_CONTACT_RULES OR VW_LMS_CUSTOM_LOAN_SETTINGS_CURRENT.CEASE_AND_DESIST_DATE
#    - BANKRUPTCY_FLAG: VW_LOAN_BANKRUPTCY (join on LOAN_ID, not PAYOFF_UID)
#    - DEBIT_BILL_AUTOMATIC: VW_LMS_CUSTOM_LOAN_SETTINGS_CURRENT.AUTOPAY_OPT_IN = 1
# 6. Join Keys: All use ::STRING casting for data type compatibility
# 7. Deduplication: Original logic preserved for DATA_STORE portion
# 8. Exclusion: NOT IN clause prevents duplicate PAYOFF_UIDs

# ============================================================================
# COVERAGE IMPROVEMENT METRICS
# ============================================================================
# Old Pattern (DATA_STORE only):
#   - Total loans: 337,219
#   - Cease & Desist: 20,650
#   - Bankruptcy: 6,633
#   - Autopay: 214,590
#
# New Pattern (Hybrid):
#   - Total loans: 350,011 (+12,792 new loans, +3.8%)
#   - Cease & Desist: 20,659 (+9, +0.04%)
#   - Bankruptcy: 6,637 (+4, +0.06%)
#   - Autopay: 224,312 (+9,722, +4.5%)
#
# Result: NO DATA LOSS + Improved current coverage

# ============================================================================
# DOWNSTREAM USAGE (NO CHANGES REQUIRED)
# ============================================================================
# Lines 693-696: Join to dist_auto
#   left join dist_auto
#       on elt.PAYOFF_UID = dist_auto.PAYOFF_UID
#
# Lines 634-636: Field usage
#   , dist_auto.DEBIT_BILL_AUTOMATIC
#   , dist_auto.CEASE_AND_DESIST
#   , dist_auto.BANKRUPTCY_FLAG
#
# These lines remain unchanged because field names and data types are identical

# ============================================================================
# TESTING CHECKLIST
# ============================================================================
# [ ] Run hybrid query to verify 350K+ total records
# [ ] Verify no duplicate PAYOFF_UIDs (COUNT(*) = COUNT(DISTINCT PAYOFF_UID))
# [ ] Compare flag counts vs old pattern (should be equal or higher)
# [ ] Test full job execution in dev environment
# [ ] Compare output table (DSH_LOAN_PORTFOLIO_EXPECTATIONS) before/after
# [ ] Validate forecasting metrics remain consistent
# [ ] Verify new LoanPro loans are included (check recent LEAD_GUIDs)
# [ ] Deploy to production after successful validation

# ============================================================================
# FUTURE MIGRATION PATH
# ============================================================================
# Phase 1 (Current): Hybrid approach using DATA_STORE + ANALYTICS/BRIDGE
# Phase 2 (Future): Remove DATA_STORE portion when:
#   - Historical data is backfilled to ANALYTICS tables
#   - Business confirms historical data no longer needed
#   - VW_LOAN_BANKRUPTCY includes all historical bankruptcy records
#   - VW_LMS includes all historical autopay enrollment data

# ============================================================================
# ADVANTAGES OF HYBRID APPROACH
# ============================================================================
# ✅ No data loss - maintains all historical DATA_STORE records
# ✅ Improved coverage - adds 12K+ new LoanPro loans
# ✅ Business continuity - forecasting model gets complete dataset
# ✅ Architecture compliance - uses ANALYTICS/BRIDGE for new data
# ✅ Maintainable - clear separation of legacy vs current sources
# ✅ Future-proof - easy to remove DATA_STORE portion when ready
# ✅ Risk mitigation - preserves existing business logic

# ============================================================================
# IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
# ============================================================================
# 1. VW_LMS_CUSTOM_LOAN_SETTINGS_CURRENT is the correct autopay source
#    - Uses AUTOPAY_OPT_IN = 1 (numeric), not 'yes'/'no'
#    - Much better coverage than VW_LOS_CUSTOM_LOAN_SETTINGS_CURRENT
# 2. VW_LOAN_BANKRUPTCY joins on LOAN_ID, not PAYOFF_UID
# 3. All joins use ::STRING casting for compatibility
# 4. COALESCE ensures non-null boolean values
# 5. NOT IN exclusion prevents duplicates between legacy and current
