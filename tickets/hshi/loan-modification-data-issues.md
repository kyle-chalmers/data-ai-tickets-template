# Loan Modification Data Issues Summary

## Core Problem
Loan modification data is **scattered across multiple systems** with **inconsistent tracking methods**, making it difficult to create reliable, comprehensive reports.

## Data Source Challenges

### 1. Agent Actions Table
- **Expected**: All loan mods should go through agent actions
- **Reality**: Some mods don't appear in agent actions table
- **Impact**: Missing data for mods that should be tracked

### 2. Notes and Alerts System
- **Process**: Agents sometimes just write notes instead of taking formal actions
- **Problem**: **No standardized format** for notes
- **Challenge**: Requires complex parsing of free-text notes to identify actual modifications
- **Risk**: Inconsistent and unreliable data extraction

### 3. SAPs (Skip-a-Pay) Programs
- **Process**: Direct system entries to change payment due dates
- **Tracking**: **No agent actions or notes** recorded
- **Method**: Agent directly modifies due dates in system
- **Challenge**: Appears as simple date changes, hard to identify as modifications

## Technical Implementation Issues

### Version Incompatibility
- **V1**: Current version with full field set (used by existing reports)
- **V2**: Simplified version focusing only on mod existence in LoanPro
- **Problem**: V2 missing critical fields (`mod_request_date`, `mod_start_date`, `mod_processing_date`) needed by existing scripts

### Data Quality Impact
- **Trustworthiness**: Data quality varies by source - "Some data is good at one place, some data is good in another place"
- **Completeness**: No single source contains all modification data
- **Reliability**: Current solution represents "best possible" given constraints

## Current Solution Status
- **V1 Implementation**: Represents best available approach using multiple data sources
- **Limitations**: Cannot capture all modifications due to system limitations
- **Workaround**: Manual post-processing required for complete accuracy

## Business Impact
- **Reporting**: Reports may be incomplete or require manual adjustments
- **Compliance**: Risk of missing modifications for regulatory reporting
- **Operations**: Additional manual work required to ensure data accuracy

## Key Data Sources Referenced
- `arcar.freshnow.loontibmodflag supplemental` view (line 250 in report script)
- Agent Actions Table
- Notes and Alerts System
- SAP (Skip-a-Pay) system entries

## Root Cause
**Fundamental data architecture problem** where modifications are recorded inconsistently across multiple systems, requiring complex consolidation logic that still can't capture everything.
