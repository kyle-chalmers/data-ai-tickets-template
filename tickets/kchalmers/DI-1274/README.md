# DI-1274: VW_LOAN_FRAUD - Consolidated Fraud Data View

## Business Summary

This ticket implements **VW_LOAN_FRAUD**, a consolidated view that serves as the single source of truth for all fraud-related loan data across Happy Money's LoanPro system. The view combines fraud indicators from three disparate sources (custom fields, portfolios, and sub-statuses) into a unified business-ready dataset.

## Key Deliverables

**✅ Production-Ready View**: `BUSINESS_INTELLIGENCE.ANALYTICS.VW_LOAN_FRAUD`
- **Data Grain**: One row per LOAN_ID with fraud indicators from any source
- **Population**: 504 loans with fraud indicators (confirmed, declined, pending, rejected)
- **Quality Control**: All validation tests passed

**✅ Core Business Capabilities**:
- **Debt Sale Suppression**: Identify loans to exclude from debt sale populations
- **Fraud Analysis**: Comprehensive fraud case timeline and volume analysis
- **Data Quality Management**: Surface inconsistencies and gaps across fraud data sources
