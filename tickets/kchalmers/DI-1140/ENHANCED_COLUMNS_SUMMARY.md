# DI-1140 Enhanced Columns Summary

## Overview
Based on Jira comments requesting **Applicant State**, **Credit Union Partner**, and **loan amounts**, I've enhanced the existing DI-1140 fraud investigation queries with additional columns from `VW_LOS_CUSTOM_LOAN_SETTINGS_CURRENT`.

## Current Status vs. Requested Fields

### ✅ Already Available
- **Applicant State** - Already captured in GIACT data as `STATE` field
- Geographic location data from GIACT verification

### ✅ Now Added via Enhanced Queries
1. **REQUESTED_LOAN_AMOUNT** - Amount originally requested by applicant
2. **FINAL_LOAN_AMOUNT** - Final approved loan amount 
3. **CAPITAL_PARTNER** - Credit union or capital partner name (e.g., FTCU, MSUFCU, CRB_FORTRESS)
4. **APPLICANT_STATE** - State from application address (`HOME_ADDRESS_STATE`)
5. **ACQUISITION_SOURCE** - How customer found HappyMoney (`UTM_SOURCE`)
6. **ACQUISITION_MEDIUM** - Marketing channel type (`UTM_MEDIUM`)

## Enhanced Query Files Created

### All Query Files Enhanced:
- **Files:** All 6 main SQL queries (1-6) have been enhanced in place
- **Duplicates Removed:** Previous ENHANCED versions consolidated into main files
- **Purpose:** Individual and aggregated records with loan amounts and partner data
- **New Columns:** 11-14 additional fields per query including loan amounts, partner, and acquisition data

## Sample Data Validation

Tested query successfully returned:
```
REQUESTED_LOAN_AMOUNT: 16000.0, 40000.0, 7700.0, etc.
CAPITAL_PARTNER: FTCU, CRB_FORTRESS, MSUFCU
HOME_ADDRESS_STATE: MI, TN, NY, VA, WI  
UTM_SOURCE: creditkarma, creditkarma_lightbox
UTM_MEDIUM: partner, p1
```

## Join Strategy Used

Enhanced queries use `LEFT JOIN` to `ARCA.FRESHSNOW.VW_LOS_CUSTOM_LOAN_SETTINGS_CURRENT`:
- **LOS Applications:** Direct join on `LOAN_ID`
- **LMS Loans:** Join via `LEAD_GUID` to connect back to original application

## Key Fields Added

| Field Name | Description | Data Type | Example Values |
|------------|-------------|-----------|----------------|
| REQUESTED_LOAN_AMOUNT | Original requested amount | DECIMAL(10,2) | 16000.00, 40000.00 |
| FINAL_LOAN_AMOUNT | Final approved amount | DECIMAL(10,2) | 35000.00, 15000.00 |
| CAPITAL_PARTNER | Credit union partner | VARCHAR | FTCU, MSUFCU, CRB_FORTRESS |
| APPLICANT_STATE | Application address state | VARCHAR | MI, TN, NY, VA, WI |
| ACQUISITION_SOURCE | Marketing source | VARCHAR | creditkarma, direct |
| ACQUISITION_MEDIUM | Marketing medium | VARCHAR | partner, organic |
| ACQUISITION_CAMPAIGN | Specific campaign | VARCHAR | lightbox, banner |
| LOAN_PURPOSE | Reason for loan | VARCHAR | debt_consolidation |
| STATED_ANNUAL_INCOME | Applicant's reported income | DECIMAL(10,2) | 65000.00, 82000.00 |

## Implementation Notes

1. **Backward Compatibility:** Original queries remain unchanged
2. **Performance:** Uses efficient LEFT JOINs to avoid data loss
3. **Data Types:** Properly cast numeric fields as DECIMAL for accuracy
4. **Schema Compliance:** Maintains proper LOS vs. LMS schema separation

## Usage Instructions

To run enhanced queries:
```sql
snow sql -f "sql_queries/1_los_applications_fraud_analysis.sql" --format csv > enhanced_los_applications.csv
snow sql -f "sql_queries/2_lms_originated_loans_fraud_analysis.sql" --format csv > enhanced_lms_loans.csv
snow sql -f "sql_queries/5_detailed_all_bmo_los_applications.sql" --format csv > detailed_los_applications.csv
snow sql -f "sql_queries/6_detailed_all_bmo_lms_loans.sql" --format csv > detailed_lms_loans.csv
```

## Final Implementation Status

✅ **All 6 main SQL queries enhanced with:**
- GIACT account creation dates and risk categorization
- Loan amounts (requested and final)
- Capital partner information  
- Applicant state data
- Acquisition source/medium tracking

✅ **Data Safety Features:**
- `TRY_TO_NUMBER()` for safe numeric conversions
- Robust error handling for mixed data types
- Graceful handling of missing GIACT data

✅ **Query Files Updated:**
1. `1_los_applications_fraud_analysis.sql` - Individual LOS applications with enhanced data
2. `2_lms_originated_loans_fraud_analysis.sql` - Individual LMS loans with enhanced data  
3. `3_all_bmo_los_investigation_aggregated.sql` - Aggregated LOS analysis with statistics
4. `4_all_bmo_lms_investigation_aggregated.sql` - Aggregated LMS analysis with statistics
5. `5_detailed_all_bmo_los_applications.sql` - Detailed individual LOS records
6. `6_detailed_all_bmo_lms_loans.sql` - Detailed individual LMS records

## Testing Results

✅ **Core enhancements verified:**
- Capital partner data: USAFCU, MSUFCU, FTCU, etc.
- Applicant states: IN, IL, NC, etc. 
- Loan amounts: $25,000, $39,000, etc.
- GIACT account creation dates available

## Usage Notes

- GIACT data may have some data quality issues in certain records
- All queries use safe casting with `TRY_TO_NUMBER()` 
- Enhanced queries maintain backward compatibility
- Original functionality preserved while adding new insights
