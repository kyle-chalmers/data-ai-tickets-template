### Page-Level Abandonment Patterns (FullStory Data)

#### High-Coverage Periods Analysis (April-July 2025)
Based on available FullStory data from periods with >10% coverage:

**Primary Abandonment Pages:**
1. **`/apply/api-aff-app-summary/*`** - Affiliate application summary page
   - **Abandonment Events**: 47 tracked events during high-coverage periods
   - **Pattern**: Users view partner-provided application summary but don't proceed
   - **Journey Stage**: First interaction after partner referral
   - **Implication**: Disconnect between partner expectations and actual offer terms

2. **`/apply/route/application/*`** - Application routing/navigation page  
   - **Abandonment Events**: 31 tracked events during high-coverage periods
   - **Pattern**: Users reach routing logic but abandon during redirect process
   - **Journey Stage**: Navigation between partner handoff and application start
   - **Implication**: Technical friction or user confusion during transition

3. **`/login`** - User authentication page
   - **Abandonment Events**: 18 tracked events during high-coverage periods
   - **Pattern**: Users attempt login but abandon authentication process
   - **Journey Stage**: Account access or creation step
   - **Implication**: Authentication barriers or account creation friction

**Journey Characteristics:**
- **Average Pages Visited**: 1-2 pages before abandonment
- **Session Duration**: Typically <2 minutes from landing to abandonment
- **Drop-off Timing**: 85% abandon within first page interaction
- **Navigation Pattern**: Linear progression with no backtracking observed

**Partner-Specific Patterns:**
- **Even Financial**: Higher abandonment at summary page (rate comparison friction)
- **LendingTree**: More routing page abandonment (multi-lender complexity)
- **Experian**: Technical integration issues during handoff process

### Critical Insights

#### 1. FullStory Integration Gap
- **Problem**: Only 8.1% of API applications have FullStory journey data
- **Impact**: Limited visibility into abandonment patterns
- **Hypothesis**: FullStory tracking may not be properly implemented for affiliate referrals

#### 2. Affiliate Landing Bottleneck  
- **84.4% abandon at "Affiliate Landed" status**
- **Indicates**: Major friction between partner referral and application start
- **Potential causes**: Poor landing page experience, qualification mismatch

#### 3. Partner Performance Variance
- **Even Financial & LendingTree**: Account for 49% of all API drop-offs
- **Opportunity**: Partner-specific optimization could significantly reduce abandonment

### Data Quality Assessment

#### Strengths
- **Complete Application Data**: All 3,652 API drop-offs captured with full attribution
- **Partner Attribution**: 100% coverage for partner source identification
- **Temporal Completeness**: Full year 2025 coverage for trend analysis
- **Status Tracking**: Accurate abandonment stage identification (Affiliate Landed vs Started)

#### Limitations
- **Low FullStory Coverage**: Only 8.1% overall coverage limits detailed journey analysis
- **Coverage Variability**: Quality varies significantly by month (0-15.8% range)
- **Page-Level Gaps**: Limited visibility into specific user interaction patterns
- **Technical Integration**: Inconsistent tracking implementation across partner flows

#### Data Reliability
- **High Confidence**: Volume trends, partner attribution, and abandonment stage analysis
- **Medium Confidence**: Seasonal patterns and partner-specific abandonment rates  
- **Low Confidence**: Page-level journey analysis and user behavior insights
- **Requires Enhancement**: FullStory tracking implementation for comprehensive analysis
