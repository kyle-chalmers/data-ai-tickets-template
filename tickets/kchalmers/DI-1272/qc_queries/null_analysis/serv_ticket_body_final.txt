During our DI-1272 analysis of VW_LMS_CUSTOM_LOAN_SETTINGS_CURRENT, we discovered that 199 of 463 LoanPro custom fields (43%) are completely unused - 100% NULL across all 127,023 LMS records as of September 2025. An additional 27 fields show minimal usage (<1% population).

This creates significant clutter in the LoanPro UI and admin interfaces. We'd like to work with your team to remove as many of these unused fields as possible to streamline the system.

Some notable findings:

- The entire Repossession module (13 fields) is completely unused
- 14 of 15 Investor tracking fields (INVESTOR1-14) contain no data
- All 9 CLS system integration fields are empty
- Extended fraud ticket slots 15-20 are unused (though slots 1-8 are active)
- Multiple bankruptcy, SCRA, settlement, and debt sale workflow fields are empty

We've attached two SQL validation queries that demonstrate the NULL status of these fields. The first query validates the 199 completely unused fields, and the second shows the 27 near-NULL fields for consideration.
