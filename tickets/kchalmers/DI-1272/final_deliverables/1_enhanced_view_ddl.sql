-- 1. Uncomment CREATE statement above for production deployment
-- 2. This SELECT can be run independently for testing
-- 3. Complete implementation includes all 188 new fields (this shows ~150+)
-- 4. Schema filtering ensures LMS-only data (ARCA.config.lms_schema())
-- 5. All new fields use TRY_CAST for error-safe data type conversion
