## üìä **Data Volume & Coverage Analysis**

### New Architecture Performance
- **FRESHSNOW View**: 284,661,725 records across 3,104,653 unique applications
- **BRIDGE View**: Successfully deployed and functional
- **ANALYTICS View**: Successfully deployed and functional  
- **Latest Record**: 2025-08-22T17:02:23 (current through yesterday)

### Existing Architecture Baseline
- **BRIDGE.VW_APPL_HISTORY**: 136,362,499 records (existing production)
- **ANALYTICS.VW_APPL_HISTORY**: 187,651,034 total records (51.3M from other sources + 136.4M LoanPro)
- **Unique Applications**: 2,841,363 in existing APPL_HISTORY

### üîç **Critical Findings**

#### 1. **Volume Discrepancy Analysis** ‚ö†Ô∏è
- **New Architecture**: 284.7M records 
- **Existing BRIDGE**: 136.4M records
- **Difference**: +148.3M additional records (+108% increase)

**Root Cause Analysis:**
- **Hypothesis 1**: New architecture includes 'Loan settings were created' records (excluded from existing)
- **Hypothesis 2**: New architecture captures broader reference types or different filtering
- **Hypothesis 3**: Existing BRIDGE applies deduplication that new architecture doesn't

#### 2. **Application Coverage Expansion** üìà
- **New**: 3,104,653 unique applications
- **Existing**: 2,841,363 unique applications  
- **Expansion**: +263,290 applications (+9.3% increase)

**Business Impact:**
- Broader historical coverage for analysis
- More complete audit trail for application changes
- Potential impact on downstream reporting volumes

## üèóÔ∏è **Architecture Layer Validation**

### FRESHSNOW Layer ‚úÖ
- **Data Source**: RAW_DATA_STORE.LOANPRO.SYSTEM_NOTE_ENTITY
- **Schema Filter**: ARCA.CONFIG.LOS_SCHEMA() applied correctly
- **JSON Parsing**: Complex nested structures processed successfully
- **Performance**: Queries completing within acceptable timeframes

### BRIDGE Layer ‚úÖ  
- **Abstraction**: Successfully references FRESHSNOW layer
- **Data Flow**: All 284.7M records accessible through BRIDGE
- **Column Mapping**: Proper schema translation implemented

### ANALYTICS Layer ‚úÖ
- **Business Logic**: Change flags and categorization working
- **Time Dimensions**: Hour, day-of-week, week, month calculations functional
- **Filtering**: Deleted and hard-deleted records properly excluded
- **Derived Fields**: Change type categories properly assigned

## üîÑ **Materialization Status**

### Materialized Table Creation
- **Status**: üîÑ **IN PROGRESS** (still creating after 10+ minutes)
- **Expected Completion**: Large dataset (284M records) requires extended processing
- **Pattern**: Following VW_APP_OFFERS ‚Üí APP_OFFERS successful model
- **Monitoring**: Background process continues, no errors detected

### Performance Implications
- **Initial Creation**: Extended time expected for 284M record dataset
- **Future Refreshes**: Will benefit from incremental strategies
- **Optimization Needed**: Consider partitioning or filtering for refresh efficiency

## üö® **Risk Assessment & Recommendations**

### HIGH PRIORITY ‚ö†Ô∏è
1. **Volume Investigation Required**
   - **Action**: Compare sample records between new/existing architectures
   - **Focus**: Understand 148M record difference source
   - **Timeline**: Before production deployment

2. **Business Rule Validation**
   - **Action**: Validate 'Loan settings were created' inclusion with stakeholders  
   - **Impact**: Confirms 263K additional applications are expected
   - **Timeline**: Business sign-off required

### MEDIUM PRIORITY üìã
1. **Materialization Optimization**
   - **Action**: Implement incremental refresh strategy
   - **Benefit**: Reduce future refresh times from hours to minutes
   - **Timeline**: Phase 2 enhancement

2. **Downstream Impact Testing**
   - **Action**: Test existing ANALYTICS consumers with new data volume
   - **Focus**: Dashboard performance, report generation times
   - **Timeline**: Before production cutover

### LOW PRIORITY ‚úÖ
1. **Performance Monitoring**
   - Current query performance acceptable
   - Architecture compliance excellent
   - Error handling robust

### BLOCKERS TO RESOLVE ‚ö†Ô∏è
1. **Volume Discrepancy**: Understand 148M record difference
2. **Business Sign-off**: Confirm expanded coverage is desired
3. **Materialization Completion**: Await table creation finish

### RECOMMENDED NEXT STEPS
1. **Sample Data Validation**: Compare known application IDs between architectures
2. **Stakeholder Review**: Present volume expansion findings for business validation
3. **Incremental Strategy**: Design optimized refresh approach for production
4. **Go-Live Planning**: Prepare cutover strategy with rollback capability
