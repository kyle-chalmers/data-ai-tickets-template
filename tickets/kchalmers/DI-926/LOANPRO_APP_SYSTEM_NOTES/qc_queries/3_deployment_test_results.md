   - Purpose: Business-ready data with calculated fields

4. **üîÑ DEVELOPMENT.FRESHSNOW.LOANPRO_APP_SYSTEM_NOTES (Materialized Table)**
   - Status: In Progress (Background creation)
   - Pattern: Following VW_APP_OFFERS ‚Üí APP_OFFERS materialization strategy

## Initial Testing Results

### Data Volume Analysis
- **New Architecture Records**: 284,661,725 total records
- **Unique Applications**: 3,104,653 unique app_ids
- **Comparison Baseline**: Existing APPL_HISTORY has 2,841,363 unique applications

### Key Findings

#### 1. **Data Coverage Expansion** 
- New architecture captures **263,290 MORE unique applications** than existing APPL_HISTORY
- This suggests our architecture includes 'Loan settings were created' records that existing APPL_HISTORY excludes
- **VALIDATION NEEDED**: Confirm this difference aligns with business requirements

#### 2. **Volume Comparison Context**
- New architecture: 284.7M records across 3.1M applications
- Original stored procedure target (CRON_STORE): 213.9M records (from earlier analysis)
- **Gap Analysis**: New architecture has higher volume - need to investigate filters and business logic differences

#### 3. **JSON Processing Success**
- Note categorization logic successfully deployed
- Complex JSON parsing operational in production data environment
- Category distribution analysis in progress

## Background Processes Status

### Currently Running
- **Materialized Table Creation**: `DEVELOPMENT.FRESHSNOW.LOANPRO_APP_SYSTEM_NOTES` 
- **Note Category Distribution**: Analyzing categorization effectiveness
- **Additional QC Queries**: Comprehensive validation in progress

### Completed Tests
- ‚úÖ **Basic Record Count**: 284.7M records validated
- ‚úÖ **Unique Application Count**: 3.1M unique applications  
- ‚úÖ **Coverage Gap Baseline**: Existing APPL_HISTORY baseline established
- ‚úÖ **View Deployment**: All 3 architectural layers successfully created

## Next Steps in Testing Queue

### Phase 1: Volume & Coverage Validation
1. Complete materialized table creation validation
2. Detailed comparison with existing APPL_HISTORY record counts
3. Business logic validation on sample data sets
4. 'Loan settings were created' inclusion analysis

### Phase 2: Dependency Impact Assessment  
1. Downstream BRIDGE layer testing
2. ANALYTICS layer integration validation
3. Schema compatibility verification with existing consumers

### Phase 3: Performance & Optimization
1. Query performance benchmarking
2. Materialized table refresh strategy validation
3. Index optimization recommendations

## Risk Assessment Update

### MEDIUM RISK ‚ö†Ô∏è
- **Volume Discrepancy**: 263K more applications than expected - requires investigation
- **Business Logic Validation**: Need to confirm JSON parsing accuracy against known samples

### LOW RISK ‚úÖ  
- **Deployment Success**: All views created without errors
- **Data Access**: Production data sources accessible and processing successfully
- **Architecture Compliance**: 5-layer pattern successfully implemented

## Recommendations

1. **Continue Background Testing**: Allow long-running queries to complete for full validation
2. **Sample Data Validation**: Test known application IDs against existing APPL_HISTORY for logic verification  
3. **Business Rule Confirmation**: Validate that including 'Loan settings were created' records aligns with requirements
4. **Performance Monitoring**: Track materialized table creation time for future refresh planning
