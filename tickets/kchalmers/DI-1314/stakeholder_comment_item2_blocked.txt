Note: "Date Last Email Sent" field is NULL - individual customer send history not available in Snowflake.

ITEM 2 (GLBA Privacy Notice / Opt-Out) - BLOCKED

Comprehensive database search found no GLBA privacy opt-out tracking in Snowflake.

Searched all schemas for: PRIVACY, GLBA, CONSENT, NOTICE, INFORMATION_SHARING patterns.

Found: RPT_UNSUBSCRIBER_SFMC (marketing emails only - CAN-SPAM, not GLBA)
Not Found: Privacy notice delivery dates or information-sharing opt-out requests

CLARIFICATION NEEDED:

1. Does Happy Money track GLBA information-sharing opt-out requests separately from marketing opt-outs?

2. If YES - where is this data stored?
   - External compliance system?
   - Manual tracking/logs?
   - Customer service system?

3. If NO - how should we document this?
   - N/A - No separate tracking exists
   - N/A - No requests received in timeframe
   - Alternative approach?

Cannot proceed with Item 2 without data source identification.
