## Data Sources Investigated

### Item 3: FCRA Negative Credit Reporting

**‚úÖ Sources Used:**
- **MVW_LOAN_TAPE_DAILY_HISTORY** - Primary source for tracking first late payment dates
  - Contains daily snapshots of loan status via ASOFDATE
  - DAYSPASTDUE field tracks delinquency days
  - Allows identifying exact first date a loan became late in scope period
- **VW_MEMBER_PII** - Borrower name data

**‚ùå Sources Ruled Out:**
- **BUSINESS_INTELLIGENCE.ANALYTICS.VW_LOAN_TAPE** - Current state only, no historical snapshots
  - Cannot determine "first late payment date" without daily history
  - Only shows current DAYSPASTDUE value, not when it first occurred
- **BUSINESS_INTELLIGENCE.ANALYTICS.VW_PAYMENTS** - Payment transaction data
  - Does not track daily delinquency status
  - Would require complex calculations to infer late payment dates
  - Less reliable than daily loan tape snapshots

**‚è≥ Still Needed:**
- Credit bureau reporting tables to confirm "Reported to CRA" status

---

## Assumptions & Notes

### CRB Originations Definition
- **Portfolio IDs 32, 34, 54, 56** represent Cross River Bank originations
- All queries filter to these portfolios only
- User confirmed this is the correct CRB filter

### Date Range Precision
- **Items 1 & 2:** October 1, 2023 - August 31, 2025 (2-year scope)
- **Items 3 & 4:** October 1, 2024 - August 31, 2025 (1-year scope)
- Date ranges differ by regulation

### First Late Payment Logic (Item 3)
- Using MVW_LOAN_TAPE_DAILY_HISTORY to track daily loan status
- "First late payment" = first date DAYSPASTDUE > 0 within scope period
- Historical snapshots via ASOFDATE field
- Need to verify credit bureau reporting submission process

### Stakeholder Clarification Needed

**Discovery Complete - 3 of 6 deliverables ready, 3 blocked pending clarification:**

**‚úÖ Ready to Deliver:**
1. Item 1.B - CAN-SPAM Email Opt-Outs (592 records)
2. Item 3 - FCRA Negative Credit Reporting (7,081 records)
3. Item 4.A - FCRA Indirect Disputes (0 records - none in timeframe)

**‚ùì Questions for Stakeholder:**

1. **Item 1 - "Date Last Email Sent" Field**:
   - Individual customer email send history is not available in Snowflake
   - DSH_EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_SENT contains campaign-level metrics only
   - **Question**: Can this field be documented as "N/A - Not Available" or do you need SFMC API data retrieval?

2. **Item 2 - GLBA Privacy / Information Sharing Opt-Outs**:
   - No privacy opt-out tables found in Snowflake (searched: PRIVACY, GLBA, CONSENT, INFORMATION_SHARING)
   - RPT_UNSUBSCRIBER_SFMC is for marketing emails only (CAN-SPAM), not privacy/information sharing
   - **Questions**:
     - Does Happy Money track GLBA information-sharing opt-out requests separately from marketing opt-outs?
     - If yes, where are these tracked? (External system, manual process?)
     - If no, can this be documented as "N/A - No requests received in timeframe"?

3. **Item 4.B - FCRA Direct Disputes (AUD)**:
   - RPT_EOSCAR_ACDV contains only indirect disputes from credit bureaus (last activity: Oct 2021)
   - No tables found for direct customer disputes (searched: AUD, DIRECT_DISPUTE, CUSTOMER_DISPUTE)
   - **Questions**:
     - Does Happy Money receive direct credit disputes from customers (bypassing bureaus)?
     - If yes, where are these tracked? (LoanPro notes, case management system, manual logs?)
     - If no, can this be documented as "N/A - No direct disputes received in timeframe"?

4. **Item 3 - "Reported to CRA" Field Approach Confirmation**:
   - Used CREDIT_REPORT_HISTORY to infer reporting status via export timing
   - Logic: If first late date < next bureau export date ‚Üí "Yes", otherwise "Pending" or "No"
   - **Question**: Is this time-based inference approach acceptable, or is there a direct loan-level reporting flag we should use?

## Next Steps

**Immediate:**
1. Post stakeholder questions to Jira (use `stakeholder_questions_jira_comment.txt`)
2. Await clarification on Items 2, 4.B, and "Date Last Email Sent" field
3. Run QC validation queries to verify deliverable quality

**After Stakeholder Response:**
4. Build queries for Item 2 (if applicable) or document as N/A
5. Build query for Item 4.B (if applicable) or document as N/A
6. Update Item 1 deliverable based on "Date Last Email Sent" decision
7. Final README updates and PR preparation
