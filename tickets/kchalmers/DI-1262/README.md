# DI-1262: LOAN_DEBT_SETTLEMENT Data Object

## Operation Summary
- **Operation Type**: CREATE_NEW
- **Scope**: SINGLE_OBJECT
- **Jira Ticket**: DI-1262 (linked to Epic DI-1238)
- **Object Name**: `LOAN_DEBT_SETTLEMENT`
- **Target Schema**: `BUSINESS_INTELLIGENCE.ANALYTICS`
- **Object Type**: DYNAMIC TABLE (preferred) or VIEW

## Business Context

### Business Purpose
Created comprehensive debt settlement data object combining custom loan settings, portfolio assignments, and loan sub status data to serve as single source of truth for debt settlement analysis and debt sale suppression.

### Primary Use Cases
- **Debt Sale Suppression**: Exclude loans with active debt settlements from debt sale files
- **Settlement Analysis**: Comprehensive analysis of debt settlement data across all sources
- **Data Quality Investigation**: Identify inconsistencies and gaps in settlement data tracking
- **Supporting Analytics**: Enable completion of DI-1246 and DI-1235

### Key Metrics/KPIs
- Count of active debt settlements by source and status
- Timeline of debt settlement agreements and completion rates
- Data completeness across settlement tracking sources
- Settlement completion percentages and financial impact

### Key Deliverables
- **Dynamic Table**: `BUSINESS_INTELLIGENCE.ANALYTICS.LOAN_DEBT_SETTLEMENT`
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: 14,074 loans with any settlement indicator
- **Multi-Source Integration**: Custom fields, portfolios, and sub status data
- **Quality Control**: Complete validation with all tests passing

## Data Architecture Design

### Target Object Definition
- **Data Grain**: One row per loan with any debt settlement indicator
- **Expected Volume**: 14,074 loans (union of all settlement sources)
- **Layer Placement**: ANALYTICS layer (references BRIDGE/ANALYTICS only) ✅
- **Deployment Strategy**: Use `documentation/db_deploy_template.sql` pattern for FRESHSNOW → BRIDGE → ANALYTICS

## Data Coverage Analysis

### Source Table Distribution
| Source Type | Loan Count | Description | Join Key |
|-------------|------------|-------------|----------|
| Custom Fields | 14,066 | Settlement data in VW_LMS_CUSTOM_LOAN_SETTINGS_CURRENT | LOAN_ID |
| Portfolios | 1,047 | Settlement portfolio assignments | LOAN_ID |
| Sub Status | 458 | "Closed - Settled in Full" status | LOAN_ID |
| **Total Union** | **14,074** | **All loans with any settlement indicator** | - |

### Data Source Overlap
- **Complete (3 sources)**: 248 loans
- **Partial (2 sources)**: 1,007 loans
- **Single source**: 12,813 loans
- **Incomplete Coverage**: Minimal overlap between sources requires comprehensive consolidation

## Quality Control Results

✅ **All Validation Tests PASSED (Optimized Query Validated)**

### Data Quality Metrics
- **Duplicate Detection**: PASS - No duplicate loans
- **LEAD_GUID Population**: PASS - All 14,074 loans have LEAD_GUID (FIXED from 2 missing)
- **CURRENT_STATUS Population**: PASS - All 14,074 loans have CURRENT_STATUS (FIXED from 13,613 missing)
- **Settlement Company Consolidation**: PASS - 100% consolidation success using COALESCE logic
- **Business Logic**: Valid settlement statuses and amounts (no negative values)
- **Join Integrity**: 100% success rate on all key joins
- **Performance**: Query execution validated with optimized structure
- **Volume Validation**: 14,074 loans (matches current data state)

### Data Quality Flags Implemented
- `DATA_SOURCE_COUNT` - Number of sources with settlement data (1-3)
- `DATA_SOURCE_LIST` - Comma-separated list of data sources
- `HAS_CUSTOM_FIELDS` - Boolean indicator
- `HAS_SETTLEMENT_PORTFOLIO` - Boolean indicator
- `HAS_SETTLEMENT_SUB_STATUS` - Boolean indicator
- `DATA_COMPLETENESS_FLAG` - 'COMPLETE', 'PARTIAL', 'SINGLE_SOURCE'

## Implementation Approach (OPTIMIZED)

### Simplified Multi-Source Strategy
1. **settlement_loans CTE** - Single UNION of loan IDs from all 3 sources (14,074 total)
   - Custom fields with settlement indicators
   - Portfolio assignments where PORTFOLIO_CATEGORY = 'Settlement'
   - Sub status where LOAN_SUB_STATUS_TEXT = 'Closed - Settled in Full'

2. **settlement_portfolios CTE** - Efficient portfolio aggregation
   ```sql
   LISTAGG(DISTINCT port.PORTFOLIO_NAME, '; ') as SETTLEMENT_PORTFOLIOS
   COUNT(DISTINCT port.PORTFOLIO_NAME) as SETTLEMENT_PORTFOLIO_COUNT
   ```

3. **Main Query** - Direct LEFT JOINs to source tables for data population
   - LEFT JOIN to VW_LMS_CUSTOM_LOAN_SETTINGS_CURRENT for settlement fields
   - LEFT JOIN to aggregated portfolios for portfolio information
   - LEFT JOIN to inline sub status query for settlement status
   - LEFT JOIN to loan status lookup for LEAD_GUID and CURRENT_STATUS

### Optimization Benefits
- **67% Complexity Reduction**: 6 CTEs → 2 CTEs
- **Eliminated UNION ALL**: Replaced complex union of full columns with simple loan ID union
- **Single Table Scans**: No redundant processing of same source data
- **Better Performance**: Efficient JOIN patterns with improved query optimization potential
- **Standard SQL Patterns**: Following established patterns from VW_LOAN_BANKRUPTCY

### Calculated Fields Strategy
- **Settlement Completion Percentage**: Calculate if NULL using `SETTLEMENT_AMOUNT_PAID / SETTLEMENT_AMOUNT * 100`
- **Data Source Tracking**: Mark which sources contain data for each loan
- **Settlement Portfolio Summary**: Aggregate like bankruptcy portfolios in VW_LOAN_BANKRUPTCY
- **Most Recent Settlement**: Using QUALIFY ROW_NUMBER() for deduplication

## Architecture Compliance

### Layer References (✅ Validated)
- **ANALYTICS layer placement approved**
- **References BRIDGE and ANALYTICS layers only**
- **Follows 5-layer architecture rules**:
  - RAW_DATA_STORE.LOANPRO → ARCA.FRESHSNOW → BRIDGE → ANALYTICS → REPORTING
- **Schema Filtering**: Proper LMS_SCHEMA() implementation
- **Uses COPY GRANTS** for permission preservation

### Development Environment Setup
```bash
# Phase 1: Create development version
snow sql -f final_deliverables/1_loan_debt_settlement_creation.sql

# Phase 2: Run QC validation
snow sql -f final_deliverables/qc_validation.sql --format csv

# Phase 3: Production deployment (after approval)
snow sql -f final_deliverables/2_production_deploy_template.sql
```

## Known Data Quality Considerations

### Issues Addressed
- **Inconsistent Statuses**: Loans with settlement custom fields but non-settlement sub statuses handled via comprehensive union
- **Partial Data Coverage**: Loans may have data in only 1-2 of the 3 sources - tracked via flags
- **NULL Field Prevalence**: Many settlement custom fields entirely NULL - excluded from final object
- **Status Misalignment**: Settlement portfolios don't always align with custom field statuses - preserved for analysis

### Data Source Priority Rules
1. **Include ALL sources** - Loans with any settlement indicator from any source
2. **No source prioritization** - Preserve all data sources as-is with NULL handling
3. **Comprehensive tracking** - Mark data source presence for every loan
4. **NULL field exclusion** - Exclude settlement fields that are entirely NULL across all loans
