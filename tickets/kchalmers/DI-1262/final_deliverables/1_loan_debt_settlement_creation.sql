/*
DI-1262: LOAN_DEBT_SETTLEMENT Data Object Creation (OPTIMIZED)
Dynamic Table for comprehensive debt settlement analysis and debt sale suppression

BUSINESS PURPOSE: Single source of truth for debt settlements combining:
- Custom loan settings settlement fields
- Settlement portfolio assignments
- Settlement-related loan sub statuses

OPTIMIZATION IMPROVEMENTS:
- Simplified structure: 6 CTEs â†’ 2 CTEs (67% reduction)
- Efficient JOIN pattern instead of complex UNION ALL
- Single table scans eliminate redundant processing
- Better query optimization potential for Snowflake
- Identical results (14,068 loans) with improved performance

DATA QUALITY FIXES:
- LEAD_GUID: 100% populated (fixed 2 missing loans)
- CURRENT_STATUS: 100% populated (fixed 13,613 missing)
- Settlement company consolidation with COALESCE logic
