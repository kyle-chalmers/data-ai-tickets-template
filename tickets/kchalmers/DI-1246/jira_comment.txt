Analysis complete for 1099-C data review. Generated dataset of 5,120 loans meeting the criteria for Collections team manual scrub.

Population breakdown: 4,891 charge-off loans (95.5%) and 229 settled in full loans (4.5%). All loans have recovery payments on or after January 1, 2025 and active bankruptcy accounts have been excluded.

Bankruptcy exclusion impact: 487 loans were excluded due to active bankruptcy status (422 Chapter 13, 58 Chapter 7, 7 unspecified). Most are in Plan Confirmed status (395 loans). Separate analysis file provided showing these excluded loans with bankruptcy details.

Data sources used: MVW_LOAN_TAPE for recovery payment data, VW_LOAN_DEBT_SETTLEMENT for settlement information, and VW_LOAN_BANKRUPTCY for bankruptcy exclusions. Quality control validation passed all tests with zero duplicates and proper date filtering confirmed.

Key assumption: "Exclude any accounts with Bankruptcy status" was interpreted as active bankruptcies only. Discharged or dismissed bankruptcies are included if they meet other criteria since they are historical and should not block 1099-C reporting.
