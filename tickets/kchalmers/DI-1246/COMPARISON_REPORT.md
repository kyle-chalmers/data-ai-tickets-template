### By Population Source

#### Charge-Off Population

- **Current:** 5,069 loans
- **Change:** +178 loans (+3.6%)
- **Impact:** Additional charged-off loans with 2025 recovery payments now included

- **Impact:** Minimal change in active bankruptcy population

## Settlement Data View Enhancement Impact

The `BUSINESS_INTELLIGENCE.ANALYTICS.VW_LOAN_DEBT_SETTLEMENT` view enhancement had **major impact on this analysis**:

**Settled in Full Population Growth:**
- Original query identified 229 "Closed - Settled in Full" loans
- Enhanced data identified 287 loans (+25.3% increase)
- 58 additional loans now have complete settlement records

**Potential Causes:**
1. **New Settlement Records:** Settlements completed between Oct 2-15, 2025
2. **Data Backfill:** Historical settlements added to the view
3. **Status Updates:** Existing settlements moved to "Closed - Settled in Full" status
4. **Data Quality Improvements:** Previously incomplete settlement records now complete

## Business Impact

### Critical for 1099-C Reporting
The 236 additional loans (especially 58 new settled-in-full loans) represent:
- Additional debt forgiveness requiring 1099-C tax forms
- Expanded scope for Collections team manual review
- Updated population for IRS reporting compliance

### Recommended Actions
1. **Immediate:** Provide updated 5,356-loan dataset to Collections team
2. **Priority Review:** Focus on 58 new settled-in-full loans for settlement validation
3. **Investigation:** Analyze 241 loans removed from population (why no longer qualifying?)
4. **Process Update:** Establish cutoff date protocol for 1099-C populations

## Data Quality Observations

### Loan Removal Analysis Needed
241 loans were removed from the population, suggesting:
- Last payment dates may have changed (data corrections)
- Settlement statuses may have been reclassified
- Bankruptcy status changes
- Data quality improvements removing invalid records

### Settlement Data Reliability
The 25.3% increase in settled-in-full population indicates:
- Settlement view is actively being enhanced/maintained
- Historical settlement data being backfilled
- Query timing sensitivity - populations can shift significantly

## Technical Notes

### Query Stability
Unlike DI-1211 (minimal change), DI-1246 showed **substantial population volatility**:
- Same query logic, different time = 4.6% population change
- Settlement data is more dynamic than placement conflict data
- Last payment dates continue to accrue through Oct 2025

### Recommended Process Improvements
1. **Snapshot-Based Analysis:** Create point-in-time snapshots for 1099-C populations
2. **Cutoff Date Protocol:** Establish fixed cutoff dates for tax reporting
3. **Change Tracking:** Monitor weekly settlement status changes
4. **Audit Trail:** Document loans added/removed between executions

3. **Notify Collections team** of population expansion
4. **Investigate loan removals** to understand data quality patterns
