# ticket-2 Work Status - October 15, 2025

## Current Status: IN PROGRESS - Comprehensive Analysis Complete, QC and Documentation Needed

### What Was Wrong with Original ticket-2
The original analysis was **INCOMPLETE** - it only checked for settlement conflicts but missed 3 other critical indicators:
1. ‚úÖ Settlement conflicts (WAS done, but incomplete)
2. ‚ùå Post-chargeoff payments (NOT done)
3. ‚ùå AutoPay still enabled (NOT done)
4. ‚ùå Future scheduled payments (NOT done)

### What Has Been Completed

#### 1. Deleted Incorrect Google Drive Backup
- Removed incomplete ticket-2 from Google Drive (DI-1246 is still there and is CORRECT)

#### 2. Archived Incomplete Results
- `archive_versions/placement_data_quality_analysis_2025-10-15_incomplete_settlement_only.csv` (501 loans - INCOMPLETE)
- `archive_versions/placement_data_quality_analysis_2025-10-15_incomplete_settlement_only_current.csv` (backup)

#### 3. Rewrote SQL Query - COMPREHENSIVE 4-INDICATOR ANALYSIS
**File**: `final_deliverables/1_placement_settlement_conflicts.sql`

**Key Technical Solutions**:
- Settlement: Join on LEAD_GUID (not LOAN_ID - it's TEXT in VW_LOAN_DEBT_SETTLEMENT)
- Settlement filter: `CURRENT_STATUS <> 'Closed - Settled in Full'` (per user requirement)
- AutoPay: Bridge join through VW_LOAN because VW_LOAN_PAYMENT_MODE.LOAN_ID is TEXT
- Post-chargeoff payments: Filter IS_SETTLED = TRUE, IS_REVERSED = FALSE, IS_REJECTED = FALSE
- Future payments: Use LOAN_ID (NUMBER) from VW_LOAN_SCHED_FCST_PAYMENTS

**Data Sources Used**:
1. `BUSINESS_INTELLIGENCE.ANALYTICS.VW_LOAN_DEBT_SETTLEMENT` - Settlement data (join on LEAD_GUID)
2. `BUSINESS_INTELLIGENCE.ANALYTICS.VW_SYSTEM_PAYMENT_TRANSACTION` - Post-chargeoff payments
3. `BUSINESS_INTELLIGENCE.ANALYTICS.VW_LOAN_PAYMENT_MODE` - AutoPay status (join via VW_LOAN.LEGACY_LOAN_ID)
4. `BUSINESS_INTELLIGENCE.BRIDGE.VW_LOAN_SCHED_FCST_PAYMENTS` - Future scheduled payments

#### 4. Ran Comprehensive Query Successfully
**Results**: **20,966 loans** (vs incomplete 501 loans - 41x increase!)

**File**: `final_deliverables/placement_data_quality_analysis.csv` (cleaned, ready)

**Output Includes**:
- All loan identifiers
- Settlement status and amounts
- Post-chargeoff payment counts and amounts
- AutoPay enabled (Y/N)
- Future scheduled payment counts and amounts
- **Conflict flags**: HAS_SETTLEMENT_CONFLICT, HAS_POST_CHARGEOFF_PAYMENTS, HAS_AUTOPAY, HAS_FUTURE_PAYMENTS
- **TOTAL_CONFLICT_COUNT**: Number of issues per loan (for prioritization)

### What Needs to Be Done Next

#### 5. Create Comprehensive QC Queries
**Create**: `final_deliverables/qc_queries/1_comprehensive_qc.sql`

**Should Include**:
```sql
-- Total record count
-- Breakdown by conflict type:
--   - Settlement conflicts only
--   - Post-chargeoff payments only
--   - AutoPay only
--   - Future payments only
-- Cross-tabulation showing overlap (loans with multiple conflicts)
-- Placement status distribution (DebtBuyerA vs DebtBuyerB)
-- Conflict count distribution (1, 2, 3, or 4 conflicts per loan)
```

#### 6. Update README.md
**File**: `README.md`

**Changes Needed**:
- Update "Latest Execution" section with new Oct 15 results
- **20,966 loans** (was 501 incomplete)
- Document all 4 data quality indicators
- Update data sources section with all 4 views
- Update assumptions to reflect comprehensive analysis
- Add settlement status clarification (NOT 'Closed - Settled in Full')
- Document TEXT vs NUMBER LOAN_ID join issues and solutions
- Update QC expectations

#### 7. Create New Comparison Report
**File**: `COMPARISON_REPORT.md`

**Should Show**:
- Incomplete analysis (Oct 15): 501 loans, settlement-only
- Complete analysis (Oct 15): 20,966 loans, 4 indicators
- Breakdown showing why 41x increase
- Business impact of finding these additional conflicts

#### 8. Commit Corrected Analysis
```bash
git add tickets/examples/ticket-2/
git commit -m "fix: ticket-2 complete comprehensive placement data quality analysis

Original analysis was incomplete - only checked settlement conflicts.
Comprehensive analysis now includes all 4 indicators:
1. Settlement conflicts (CURRENT_STATUS <> 'Closed - Settled in Full')
2. Post-chargeoff payments (9,910+ charged-off loans receiving payments)
3. Active AutoPay (333,415 loans with 'Auto Payer' status)
4. Future scheduled payments (loans with DATE > CURRENT_DATE())

Results: 20,966 loans with placement conflicts (vs 501 incomplete)

Technical fixes:
- Join VW_LOAN_DEBT_SETTLEMENT on LEAD_GUID (LOAN_ID is TEXT)
- Bridge AutoPay via VW_LOAN.LEGACY_LOAN_ID (PAYMENT_MODE.LOAN_ID is TEXT)
- Use VW_LOAN_SCHED_FCST_PAYMENTS.LOAN_ID (NUMBER field)

Deliverables:
- Comprehensive SQL with 4-indicator CTEs
- 20,966-loan CSV with conflict flags and counts
- QC queries showing breakdown by conflict type
- Updated documentation with all data sources

#### 9. DO NOT Backup to Google Drive Yet
Wait until user confirms the corrected analysis is accurate before backing up.

## Key Technical Notes for Next Session

### TEXT vs NUMBER LOAN_ID Issues
- `VW_LOAN_DEBT_SETTLEMENT.LOAN_ID` = TEXT (values like 'LAI-00070570')
- `VW_LOAN_PAYMENT_MODE.LOAN_ID` = TEXT (values like 'LAI-00168370')
- `VW_LOAN.LOAN_ID` = NUMBER
- **Solution**: Join settlement on LEAD_GUID, autopay via LEGACY_LOAN_ID bridge

### Settlement Status Values
User confirmed: Include all statuses EXCEPT "Closed - Settled in Full"

Common values in VW_LOAN_DEBT_SETTLEMENT.CURRENT_STATUS:
- "Closed - Charged-Off Collectible" (12,948)
- "Closed - Settled in Full" (557) - EXCLUDE THIS
- "Closed - Charged-Off" (451)
- "Open - Repaying" (114)
- "Paid Off - Paid In Full" (117)
- "Closed - Bankruptcy" (5)

### Output Requirements
- User wants 1 row per loan (ensured via proper aggregation in CTEs)
- Single comprehensive query with all 4 indicators
- Conflict flags for easy filtering and prioritization

## Branch Status
- Branch: `ticket-2_DI-1246_settlement_data_rework`
- Pushed to remote: YES
- Contains: Correct DI-1246 work, IN-PROGRESS ticket-2 work
- Next commit will complete ticket-2 corrections
