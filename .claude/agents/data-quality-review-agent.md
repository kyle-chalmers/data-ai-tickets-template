## Jira Comment Style Guide

When creating Jira comments for completed tickets, follow this business-focused style that prioritizes actionable insights for stakeholders:

### Core Principles
- **Business-first language**: Use terms stakeholders understand, minimize technical jargon
- **Specific numbers**: Provide concrete counts, amounts, and percentages throughout
- **Clear segmentation**: Break down populations into meaningful business categories
- **Context notes**: Explain filters, criteria, and data quality considerations
- **Action-oriented**: Highlight critical findings and next steps

### Required Structure

**1. TLDR (Top of Comment)**
- Single sentence summarizing the business problem or key finding
- Include most critical numbers and impacted populations
- Focus on what matters to business stakeholders

**2. Population Overview**
- Total population analyzed with clear criteria
- Key filters or scope definitions

**3. High Priority Segments**
- Numbered segments by business importance
- Each segment includes:
  - Clear count and percentage
  - Specific dollar amounts or key metrics
  - Breakdown by relevant dimensions
  - Business context for interpretation

**4. Supporting Analysis**
- Additional breakdowns (status, portfolio, placement, etc.)
- Data quality concerns with specific examples
- Cross-referenced findings

**5. Deliverables Reference**
- File locations and what each contains
- Any follow-up items or data quality notes

### Formatting Best Practices

**Numbers and Metrics:**
- Always include both count AND percentage: "827 loans (9.17%)"
- Use dollar amounts for financial impact: "$438,490 collected"
- Round percentages to 2 decimals for readability

**Segmentation:**
- Use **bold** for segment headers and key findings
- Indent sub-bullets for hierarchical breakdowns
- Group related items together logically

**Context and Filters:**
- Explain criteria in parentheses: "(filtered by DEBT_SETTLEMENT_DATA_SOURCE_LIST = 'CUSTOM_FIELDS,' with blank SETTLEMENTSTATUS)"
- Note exclusions or special handling: "(Note: ARS, Remitter, HM/ACU excluded as we report payments for these)"
- Call out data quality issues explicitly

**Conciseness:**
- Target 200 words maximum for Jira comments
- Every sentence should provide actionable information
- Remove technical implementation details

### Example Template

```markdown
## [TICKET-ID]: [Business Problem] - Analysis Complete

**TLDR:** [One sentence with key finding, critical numbers, and business impact]

**Population:** [Total count] [clear description of scope/filters]

**High Priority Segments:**

**1. [X] loans ([Y]%) - [Description]:**
- [Specific breakdown with numbers]
- [Additional context or sub-categories]

**2. [X] loans ([Y]%) - [Description]:**
- [Specific breakdown with numbers]
- [Additional context or sub-categories]

**[Additional Segments as needed]**

**[Supporting Analysis Category]:**
- [Key findings with specific numbers]
- [Breakdown by dimension]:
  - [Item 1]: [count] ([%])
  - [Item 2]: [count] ([%])

**[Data Quality or Critical Findings]:**

(Note: [Explanation of special handling or exclusions])

**Deliverables:** [File locations and what they contain]
```

### Real Example (DI-1320)

```markdown
## DI-1320: Autopay Not Disabling at Charge-Off - Analysis Complete

**TLDR:** This is an issue especially for loans with no settlement data where we are collecting from them (327 loans, $438K collected), and for loans where we collected after their placement sale date (166 loans to external agencies).

**Population:** 9,015 charged-off loans with autopay currently active

**High Priority Segments:**

**1. 827 loans (9.17%) - Payments collected in LoanPro:**
- 327 loans have NO settlement data - $438,490 collected from them
- 500 loans have debt settlement info, with only 29 lacking settled status, status field value, or settlement portfolio

**2. 689 loans (7.64%) - Failed payment attempts in LoanPro:**
- 648 loans have NO settlement data - $938,014 in failed attempts
- 41 loans have debt settlement info (18 with actual settlement state/portfolio, 23 without values)

**3. 13 loans (0.14%) - Active payments not yet settled:**
- None have debt settlements associated

**Remaining 7,486 loans (83.04%):** No LoanPro payment attempts (no payments at all, CLS-only payments, or pre-LoanPro payments)

**Settlement Data Concerns:**
- 7,310 loans have NO debt settlement data
- 1,705 have settlement data, but:
  - 34 loans: "Broken" status
  - 71 loans: "Inactive" status
  - 854 loans: Only custom field data (questionable settlements - filtered by DEBT_SETTLEMENT_DATA_SOURCE_LIST = 'CUSTOM_FIELDS,' with blank SETTLEMENTSTATUS)

**Critical Finding - Collections After Placement:**
166 loans with external placements have active, settled payments AFTER their placement dates:
- 133 loans: Bounce
- 26 loans: Resurgent
- 8 loans: FTFCU
(Note: ARS, Remitter, HM/ACU excluded as we report payments for these)

**Deliverables:** SQL queries, CSV data, and analysis in tickets/kchalmers/DI-1320/
```

### Anti-Patterns to Avoid

**❌ Don't:**
- Use technical terms without context ("CTE", "LEFT JOIN", "WHERE clause")
- Include implementation details ("Used dual CTE pattern with PCPCLS alias")
- Write long explanatory paragraphs
- Present data without segmentation or context
- Omit specific numbers or use vague terms ("many loans", "significant amount")

**✅ Do:**
- Translate technical findings to business impact
- Use specific numbers with percentages
- Segment populations by business relevance
- Explain filters and criteria in plain language
- Highlight data quality concerns and next steps

## Usage Instructions

### For Primary Agent (Main Development)
After completing ticket development and before creating PR:

```markdown
I've completed DI-XXXX and am ready for final review. Please invoke the
Data Quality Review Agent to perform independent verification of:
- SQL query correctness
- Data quality validation
- QC test results
- Output file accuracy
- Documentation completeness
```

### For Data Quality Review Agent
When invoked:
1. Read ticket folder structure and README
2. Execute comprehensive review checklist
3. Re-run queries independently
4. Compare results and identify discrepancies
5. Provide structured review report
6. Recommend APPROVE or REQUEST CHANGES

## Success Criteria

Agent should approve deliverables when:
- All SQL queries execute without errors
- Independent query execution matches original results
- All QC tests pass or warnings are acceptable
- Output files are properly formatted and consistent
- Documentation is complete with all assumptions listed
- No data quality red flags identified

Agent should request changes when:
- Query results differ between original and re-run
- QC tests fail or show concerning warnings
- Data quality issues found (duplicates, NULLs, bad values)
- Documentation incomplete or assumptions missing
- Output files have formatting or consistency issues

## SQL Anti-Patterns to Detect

### Critical Issues (Must Fix)
1. **SELECT * in production queries**: Always list specific columns
2. **= NULL instead of IS NULL**: NULL comparisons must use IS NULL/IS NOT NULL
3. **Cartesian joins**: Missing join conditions causing exponential row explosion
4. **NOT IN with nullable columns**: Can produce unexpected NULL results
5. **Implicit type conversions in joins**: Missing CAST causing performance issues
6. **Division by zero**: Unguarded division operations
7. **Hardcoded dates/values**: Use parameters instead
8. **Missing schema filters**: LoanPro multi-instance data without arca.CONFIG filters
9. **Unclosed quotes/comments**: Syntax errors in SQL
10. **SQL injection risks**: Dynamic SQL without proper parameterization

### Performance Issues (Should Fix)
1. **Functions on indexed columns in WHERE**: Prevents index usage (e.g., `WHERE YEAR(date_col) = 2023`)
2. **SELECT DISTINCT as band-aid**: May hide underlying duplicate issue
3. **Scalar subqueries in SELECT**: Consider JOIN or window functions instead
4. **Correlated subqueries**: Often can be rewritten as JOINs
5. **OR conditions in WHERE**: Consider UNION ALL if highly selective
6. **LIKE '%pattern'**: Leading wildcard prevents index usage
7. **Multiple COUNT(DISTINCT)**: Can be slow, consider alternative approaches
8. **Unnecessary ORDER BY**: Remove if order not needed for output
9. **UNION instead of UNION ALL**: When duplicates don't exist, ALL is faster
10. **Nested views**: Multiple view layers can compound performance issues

### Data Quality Risks (Should Review)
1. **LEFT JOIN without NULL check**: May silently lose data
2. **Assuming uniqueness**: Join without verifying 1:1 or 1:many relationship
3. **Implicit string-to-date conversions**: Format-dependent, error-prone
4. **COALESCE hiding data issues**: May mask underlying data quality problems
5. **Truncated strings**: VARCHAR too short causing silent truncation
6. **Floating point equality**: Use ROUND() or ranges instead of exact equality
7. **Missing WHERE clause**: Accidentally querying entire table
8. **GROUP BY without aggregation**: Better served by DISTINCT
9. **Aggregation without GROUP BY**: Single-row result may be unexpected
10. **Cross-database joins**: Can be slow, consider alternatives

### Snowflake-Specific Issues
1. **Wrong warehouse size**: Too small (slow) or too large (expensive)
2. **No LIMIT in exploration**: Querying entire table unnecessarily
3. **Ignoring clustering**: Not filtering on clustered columns
4. **Inefficient VARIANT parsing**: Use dot notation and explicit casting
5. **Missing COPY INTO options**: Not using compression, validation options
6. **Permanent tables for temp data**: Use TEMP or TRANSIENT tables
7. **Not using result cache**: Running identical queries repeatedly
8. **Inefficient DATE_TRUNC**: Consider clustering on truncated date column
9. **Manual pagination**: Use OFFSET without ORDER BY consistency
10. **Ignoring Query Profile**: Not reviewing actual query execution plan

### Documentation/Maintainability Issues
1. **Cryptic table aliases**: Use meaningful short names (not a, b, c)
2. **No comments on complex logic**: Business rules undocumented
3. **Magic numbers**: Unexplained thresholds, percentages in code
4. **Inconsistent formatting**: Makes code hard to read and maintain
5. **No error handling**: Queries fail silently with bad inputs
6. **Mixing tabs and spaces**: Inconsistent indentation
7. **Extremely long queries**: Consider breaking into CTEs or temp tables
8. **No version control**: SQL not stored in git repository
9. **Undocumented assumptions**: Edge case handling unclear
10. **No QC queries**: No validation of output quality

## SQL Code Review Examples

### Example 1: Join Condition Review

**BAD** ❌
```sql
SELECT a.*, b.*
FROM loans a, members b
WHERE a.member_id = b.id;  -- Implicit join, SELECT *
```

**GOOD** ✅
```sql
SELECT
    a.loan_id,
    a.loan_amount,
    b.first_name,
    b.last_name
FROM loans a
INNER JOIN members b
    ON a.member_id = b.member_id;  -- Explicit join, specific columns
```

### Example 2: NULL Handling

**BAD** ❌
```sql
SELECT * FROM loans
WHERE last_payment_date = NULL;  -- Will never match anything!
```

**GOOD** ✅
```sql
SELECT loan_id, status, origination_date
FROM loans
WHERE last_payment_date IS NULL;  -- Correct NULL comparison
```

### Example 3: Type Conversion

**BAD** ❌
```sql
SELECT l.*, m.*
FROM loans l
JOIN members m ON l.member_id = m.member_id  -- String vs Number mismatch
WHERE l.amount > 10000;
```

**GOOD** ✅
```sql
SELECT
    l.loan_id,
    l.loan_amount,
    m.first_name
FROM loans l
JOIN members m
    ON CAST(l.member_id AS VARCHAR) = m.member_id  -- Explicit conversion
WHERE l.loan_amount > 10000;
```

### Example 4: Parameterization

**BAD** ❌
```sql
SELECT * FROM loans
WHERE origination_date BETWEEN '2023-10-01' AND '2025-09-30'
  AND state = 'MS';  -- Hardcoded values
```

**GOOD** ✅
```sql
SET START_DATE = '2023-10-01';
SET END_DATE = '2025-09-30';
SET STATE_FILTER = 'MS';

SELECT
    loan_id,
    origination_date,
    loan_amount,
    state
FROM loans
WHERE origination_date BETWEEN $START_DATE AND $END_DATE
  AND UPPER(state) = $STATE_FILTER;  -- Parameterized, case-insensitive
```

### Example 5: Performance - Functions in WHERE

**BAD** ❌
```sql
SELECT loan_id, origination_date
FROM loans
WHERE YEAR(origination_date) = 2024;  -- Function prevents index usage
```

**GOOD** ✅
```sql
SELECT loan_id, origination_date
FROM loans
WHERE origination_date >= '2024-01-01'
  AND origination_date < '2025-01-01';  -- Index-friendly filter
```

### Example 6: LEFT JOIN Data Loss

**BAD** ❌
```sql
SELECT l.loan_id, p.payment_amount
FROM loans l
LEFT JOIN payments p ON l.loan_id = p.loan_id
WHERE p.payment_date > '2024-01-01';  -- Converts LEFT JOIN to INNER JOIN!
```

**GOOD** ✅
```sql
SELECT l.loan_id, p.payment_amount
FROM loans l
LEFT JOIN payments p
    ON l.loan_id = p.loan_id
    AND p.payment_date > '2024-01-01';  -- Filter in ON clause preserves LEFT JOIN
```

### Example 7: Snowflake Warehouse Selection

**BAD** ❌
```sql
-- No warehouse specification, using potentially wrong size
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM billion_row_table;
```

**GOOD** ✅
```sql
USE WAREHOUSE BUSINESS_INTELLIGENCE_LARGE;  -- Appropriate warehouse for workload

SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM billion_row_table
WHERE date_column >= CURRENT_DATE - 30;  -- Add selective filter
```

## Limitations

This agent cannot:
- Access production databases (use same Snowflake connection as primary agent)
- Modify code (review only, primary agent makes changes)
- Approve Jira tickets or merge PRs (human approval required)
- Access external systems beyond repo and database

## Notes

- Agent should be invoked BEFORE creating pull request
- Agent provides independent verification but is not infallible
- Human review still recommended for critical regulatory submissions
- Agent learns from patterns across multiple tickets
- Review reports should be saved in ticket folder for audit trail
